Currently shooting WiaWis CX7 limbs. I consider these good mid grade limbs, probably similar to Hoyt Integra, mid tier Gillo, etc. Would there be much difference in arrow speed or cast with a high end limb from Hoyt or WiaWis? The high end limbs being lighter/narrower etc.

There are a lot of factors. Not all high end limbs are the same speed. Some mid range limbs are surprisingly fast.

A good estimate (and just an estimate) is to take the difference in mass weight of a given set of otherwise identical limbs. Adjust the arrow weight by about half that difference. The difference in speed between your original arrow and your modified one will be pretty close to the difference in speed between the limbs. But it’s a rough estimate, at best.

There are certainly other factors which influence arrow speed, such as the draw force curve of the limbs, the air resistance, and the efficiency (noise). And speed isn’t necessarily the most important factor when choosing a set of limbs. Torsional stability, for example, translates to accuracy more directly.

You’ll certainly notice a difference. Going from Winex to MXT limbs, an archer I know had to adjust her sight more than half an inch for 70m. But that’s a pretty extreme example and had some other factors at play as well, so I wouldn’t attribute it all to the limbs.

I think you know the answer - probably a small gain. The underlying question is will it make a difference in your shooting? A small change, perhaps. If you just feel you want new limbs because it will make you happy and it is in the budget, go for it. The "feel" factor is important too. Are the old limbs stacking or don't feel as smooth as your buddy's bow with different limbs? My Integra limbs certainly feel better than the budget limbs I shot previously, and I am very satisfied. For me high end limbs are not in the budget, and I don't think I would enjoy shooting any more, or realize improved performance with high end limbs. But you can decide.

Just read FerrumV's response. Excellent points about torsional stability and efficiency.

From ~25-30# high end limbs (speed) like Uukha, MXTs, C-88 make a HUGE difference an WILL buy points for archers struggling to reach 50M/70M. I.E. at the transition point of being able to aim point on(BB) or have and actual sight mark for the distance versus having to hold high on the target.

After that, assuming and intermediate limb will have decent cross carbon stability, I would venture the advantage tapers off 35-40ish+#.
Depending on arrow mass, draw length, etc.

It kinda depends on where you are right now. Indoors, while the "feel" might be different, the benefit is subjective at best. For longer distances, yes, there's a SMALL speed advantage, but typically not enough to prevent reaching longer distances (assuming the same draw weight and arrow weight). I'd venture a guess at 10 fps between the slowest and fastest limbs out there.

The real advantage in good high-end limbs is in their stability, and unless you're shooting at a very high level, it's not something that will ever show on the target. That, however, doesn't include the placebo effect, which fortunately or not, is quite real.

Viper1 out.

Speed has never factored into the equation for me when looking at limbs. If I want more speed out of my setup, I’d look at going up in weight. And then arrow weight and then string material. When looking at high end limbs, the factors I look at were core material and features that would improve my performance, like torsional rigidity.
__
Great example how the benefit tapers off for those who CAN go up in draw weight. For those who can NOT, at least not with proper control, speed is not trivial. Short draw/women/youth archers most benefit from that aspect. I mean like +100 points for a 720 round when you turn that corner. No exaggeration. That would be the only point I'd recommend a $800 vs. $300 set if budget is a factor.

That said, I am not referring to most high end limbs, only the few models that are actually faster.

The difference in speed between a set of WIAWIS NS and MK Veracity and Hoyt Axia won’t have an effect on performance.

The difference in speed between a set of Galaxy Bronze Stars and one of those above absolutely can.

Where it gets tricky is in the mid-range. There are some mid-range limbs that are plenty fast.

If you’re challenged with distance, I would also look at your bow setup. When I was in college we looked at archers shooting 68” with short draw(<27”) and those shooting 70” with draw less than 29” and the efficiency of the bow was much less.
Basically if you’re shooting 29” or less you should be shooting a bow shorter than 70”. And if your shooting less that 27”, then you should be poking at at 66” bow

For cheap limbs (~USD100) basically anything goes. This is what you want to stay with if you're going up in poundage as it saves money. Mid-range limbs can also work great if your budget allows it.
For more mid-range limbs it can be good to stick with known brands.
For high-end limbs, go with limbs you enjoy shooting with.

Best is to of course go to a shop and try limbs out.

In my area, we praise limbs from WNS a lot.

For <100USD, WNS W1 is a solid choice. You can keep using it from 20# to 30# draw weight. For >30#, you may consider next price range.

For 100-200USD, you may consider WNS C3/F3. They feel slightly better than WNS W1. If you plan on not upgrading the limbs for long period of time, you may consider saving some more money for next price range.

For 200-400USD, WNS C5/F5/G7 are nice (C5 is my personal recommendation for this price range). You should have no problem competing in high level game.

If you are starting, simply get a pair of $99 limbs. WNS Explore series or Galaxy Bronze Star will work very well for you. When you get to your idea draw weight, then think about more expensive limbs.
