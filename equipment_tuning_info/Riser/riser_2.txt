A little backstory, I was shooting an ATF-DX until about 4 months ago when I got an unexpected vet bill that caused me to have to sell it. Now that the majority of the financial burden has subsided, I've had the opportunity to speak with my wife and can afford a modest intermediate level bow at about $400.

(Edit to make it clear this is for Olympic recurve)

I still have the rest of my setup that I love (RamRods Vektors, Vellator v3 limbs, Axcel Achieve, etc.) so I don't have to rebuild my entire setup and devote my entire budget to a riser.

I've looked at risers ranging from $200 to $400 give or take, and I'm trying to choose from the following:

RCRV Podium (feel like this one is first one out after watching Jake K.'s review)

Seb Flute Ignio Seb Flute EVO Seb Flute Newton (seems like not enough of an upgrade over the EVO for the money?) WNS Quantum AX WNS Vantage AX

What's the latest thinking regarding these riser models?

I've googled a ton but reviews range from being a couple months old to several years old.

The ones I'm very torn between are the Ignio, EVO, and the two WNS models.

Thanks in advance!

I’ll throw this out there - I have an RCRV Podium and it’s a great riser. Jake Kaminsky does some great reviews, but I don’t think he’s very good at reviewing intermediate gear. Maybe he’s too used to the high end.

The biggest problem with the RCRV Podium is its availability. I ordered mine back in December of 2024 and it finally showed up in May 2025. I am glad I waited it out though.
