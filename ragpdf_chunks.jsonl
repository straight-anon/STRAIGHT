The \ntechnique is quick and simple, requiring little effort on the part of the archer. The technique \nincorporates the use of the archer’s weight and natural levers. \n \n \nPlace one hand flat against the target with \nthe shaft between the thumb and index \nfinger, this helps to support the target butt \nwhen withdrawing the arrow the arrow \nshaft.

In this case the archer rests their \nforearm against the butt and uses their elbow as a lever to exert additional force onto the \narrow. It may even be necessary for two archers to work together to remove arrows. \n \nThe important point is to remember to support the target butt to ensure it does not pull \nforward when withdrawing arrows. Never hold the arrow along the shaft or at the fletched \nend of the arrow; this may cause the arrow to bend, but most importantly, you will not be \nable to exert enough force to easily remove the arrows from the target butt. \n \nEQUIPMENT SAFETY \nCoaches are responsible to ensure the equipment being used by participants is safe and in \ngood working order \n \nIt is recommended participants are included in this inspection to assist them in identifying \npotential equipment hazards \n \nEQUIPMENT SAFETY REQUIREMENTS \n• Equipment should ALWAYS be damage free to prevent injuries from occurring \n• ALWAYS ensure an equipment inspection is completed before commencing any \narchery activities \n• ALWAYS ensure equipment and participants are matched to suit individual \nrequirements \n• ALWAYS ensure equipment is matched to the participant (size, poundage, eye \ndominance) \n \nETIQUETTE \nArchery participants MUST be aware of archery etiquette whilst considering the rights and \nfeeling of others. \n \nRegardless of age, appropriate archery etiquette should be included as part of the safety \neducation process \n \nArchery etiquette is a lifelong consideration in any archery activities \n \nParticipants should NOT \n• talk or disturb other participants on the shooting line \n• smoke or drink on the shooting line \n• remark on another archers performance during shooting \n• complain on the field"}

Nocking \npoints are fitted to the serving to provide a consistent point to place the arrow on the string \nprior to shooting. \n \nIf the top and bottom string loops are manufactured the same size you can determine the top \nof the string by folding the string in half. The upper loop is that loop which is on the side of \nthe string-half to which nock points are applied. \n \nThe Bow Stringer \nA bow stringer is a device designed to string bows. Bow stringers come in two basic \ndesigns, double pocket or saddle type. Both types have a strong nylon cord which has on \none end a large leather (or rubber) pocket which fits over the bottom limb tip and at the other \nend, in the case of the “Double Pocket Type”, a smaller leather (or rubber) pocket or in the \ncase of the “Saddle Type”, a saddle made of rubber or leather having a dimpled rubber \nsurface. \n \nWith both style of bow stringers, the larger pocket fits onto the bottom limb tip over the string \nand helps in keeping the string in place."}

If using the saddle type bow stringer place the dimpled \nsaddle of the stringer over the upper limb and below the bowstring loop. Slide the dimpled \nsaddle of the stringer along then upper limb of the bow and locate it directly behind the \nupper string loop. \n• While holding the bow by the handle around the grip with \none hand (if using the saddle type stringer) position the \ndimpled saddle with the other hand. Allow the cord of the \nstringer to touch the ground and place the ball of one or \npreferably both feet onto the cord. Under no circumstances \nshould the cord be located under the arch of the foot, as \nthis will allow the cord to slip when the tension is taken up. \nIt is recommended that children use both feet. \n \n \n• Take up the slack in the cord and place the thumb \nand index finger of your free hand on each edge of the \nbow limb located just behind the string loop and take up \nthe slack in the bow string. \n \n \n• In one action draw up using the hand holding the bow. This \ncauses the limbs to bend downwards. At the same time, slide \nthe string up the limb with the other hand until it engages with \nthe string nock. \n \n• Using your finger, check that the string is seated correctly in the bow nock."}

Therefore, a good rule to keep in \nmind when considering when to give feedback is “When in doubt, be quiet.” \n \nRecent research indicates that people profit more from feedback when they ask for it than \nwhen someone else (e.g., instructor, coach) decides they need it. Interestingly, these \nstudies also show that learners are able to improve their skills with relatively little extrinsic \nfeedback. In one study, participants who were instructed to ask for extrinsic feedback \nwhenever they wanted it asked for it less than 10 percent of the time. \n \nMoreover, most of their feedback requests occurred during their first few learning sessions. \nThese findings suggest that you should resist the temptation to provide assistance more \nfrequently and instead allow athletes to practice their skills on their own. Of course, the \nmore difficult the technical skill, the more likely they will want your feedback. \n \nLeast helpful for athletes is extrinsic feedback that is virtually identical to their intrinsic \nfeedback. An archer that hits their arm with the bow string doesn’t want to hear the coach \nsay, “You hit your bow arm on release.” Therefore, your goal should always be to provide \nfeedback only when athletes are unable to pick it up on their own. If the archer asks why \nthey keep hitting there arm, indicates that they don’t know the reason and needs extrinsic \nfeedback. If you have established good communication with your athletes, (you should be \nable to discern when they need feedback and when they don’t). Moreover, if your athletes \nenjoy open communication with you, they are more likely to request extrinsic feedback \nwhen they need it. \n \nSince all learning involves some sort of problem solving, the most helpful feedback you can \nprovide points athletes toward relevant sources of intrinsic feedback. \n \nOnce athletes are able to identify relevant intrinsic feedback on their own, they will need \neven less extrinsic feedback from you. Program feedback is more important during the \nbeginning stage of technical skill practice when athletes are getting the general idea of the \nrelative timing pattern of a movement, while parameter feedback is more important after \nathletes demonstrate that they can produce the fundamental pattern on a consistent basis. \n \nThe games approach to practice suggests that athletes need to be given the opportunity to \ndevelop their skills in an independent fashion and engage in their own problem solving. \nOnly when they appear to be at a dead end in their search for solutions or when they stop \npracticing and ask for your assistance should you offer feedback. The powerful aspect of \nthis approach is that it allows you to capitalize on those teachable moments when athletes \nare motivated to hear what you have to say and more likely to incorporate it after they do. \n \nHow Much Feedback to Give \nThe most important principle to remember when it comes to deciding how much feedback to \ngive is “keep it simple.” Simple, however, does not mean simplistic. On the contrary, your \nfeedback should provide athletes with the most helpful information possible. Keeping \nextrinsic feedback simple means giving athletes the type of feedback that is most relevant \nat a particular moment. In other words, quality is more important than quantity. That way \nyou will direct athletes’ attention to the most important information without overloading them."}

Extrinsic feedback for a novice archer should be restricted to one or two specific \naspects of performance. \n \nIf the novice archer is learning how to draw the bow, you might tell them to “keep their \nshoulder alignment” or “Stand upright” or “keep your head still.” However, once the archer \nhas acquired the basic movement pattern for drawing the bow , you could tell them to \n“maintain your structure” because the archer would then know that “maintain your structure” \nmeans maintaining alignment, balance , and stability. \n \nHow Often to Give Feedback \nRecent research suggests that more frequent feedback is not necessarily better when it \ncomes to promoting skill development. In fact, many studies have shown that practicing \nwithout extrinsic feedback can actually be more beneficial than practicing with it. Possible \nreasons for performance improvements in the absence of extrinsic feedback are that \nlearners are forced to do more of their own problem solving and they devote more of their \nattention to available intrinsic feedback. \n \nHow Detailed the Feedback Should Be \nThe research on feedback precision suggests that extrinsic feedback does not need to be \nextremely precise to be effective. This is particularly true during early learning, when \nathletes are just trying to get a general idea of the correct relative timing pattern. At that \npoint, all they need to know is general information about the relative amount and direction of \ntheir errors. \n \nWhat you need to do is determine a performance parameter for archers that allows them to \nimprove their technical skills as much as possible without your assistance."}

This type of thinking is flawed insofar as to say that the “Holding”\nposition can never be achieved. When we draw the bow, we cannot use our back\nmuscles alone, but we must use a certain amount of forearm and hand as well.\nHowever, if we would continue the draw uninterruptedly, we would pass the\n“Holding” position where we need to transfer as much tension as possible from\nthe drawing forearm and hand to the back muscles. Therefore, if no “Holding” is\nachieved, no tension transfer can take place. During the transfer stage, the back\nmuscles continue to move the Scapulae towards the spine, while tension from\nthe forearm and draw hand are being transferred. This movement of the\nScapulae, although very small, must continue through the expansion and\ntherefore the Law of Inertia can only be applied from \"Holding\" and not from\nthe commencement of the draw.\nThe Shot Cycle\nSet-up\nEvery sport has a set-up position. \nLook at the sprinter getting ready for the start. The body is being positioned in such\na manner so as to achieve the best biomechanical combination of all parts. To explode\nfrom the blocks requires a very complicated neuromuscular coordination, eliminating\nat the same time any antagonistic factors which could hinder this process."}

As part of the\nset-up, the shoulders must be aligned with the target and the rear scapula set\nback and down, almost in the final position.

If the archer shoots with continuous\nexternal movement, they will pass the holding phase, thereby achieving no real\nconsistency. As a result, scores will fluctuate greatly and become an obstacle in\nachieving shooting high scores. \nHolding is extremely crucial; in essence, it can be referred to as the “barrel of\nthe gun”. If there is no proper holding, then the “barrel of the gun” is shorter or\nnon- existent and consequently less consistency is achieved. Therefore, the\ncurrent accepted method of teaching “continuous external movement” is flawed. \nWhen drawing the string to the anchor point, one has to use at least some upper\narm, fore arm and hand muscles, as the string cannot be pulled back by the\nscapula muscles alone. EMG equipment demonstrates this. In addition, it shows\nthat there is no relaxation of the digitorum muscle, which controls the fingers.\nTherefore, there will be tension in these muscles, which in turn will need to be\ntransferred to the bigger core muscles.\nThis transfer/loading should normally take about half a second. As already\nstated, it is only from the holding position the Law of Inertia will come into play.\nThis can be compared to a heavy roller used on clay tennis courts, stationary it\nhas a lot of inertia but once it is moving, it can be pulled with one finger. The\nsame goes for the expansion phase. If this expansion phase is stopped, an\nenormous amount of energy and muscle power will be required. This is not only\nfatiguing, but will prevent a smooth and strong shot being made.\nIn addition, aiming should commence from holding only. If aiming commences\ntoo early, the focus will be on aiming and keeping sight alignment, therefore, as\nsuch, bypassing the transfer/loading and holding phase. \nHeart rate monitors are good scientific indicators to check that holding has\nbeen achieved.

However, the 50/50 balance between the\nfront and rear units need to be maintained at all times.\nFor better coordination, it is recommended that right-handed archers, being left\neye dominant, shoot right-handed and vice versa for left-handed archers being\nright eye dominant. \nFITA in their latest coaching manual states “To date, good results have been\nachieved using either criterion. However, hand (preference) gives a better\nmanual ease, control and strength”. \nMost archers think too much about aiming. Archery is a technical sport and not\nan aiming sport which is why we should follow the hand dominant side and not\neye dominance.\n76\nTOTAL ARCHERY"}

To be able to create the maximum\nhorizontal distance for a shot, a certain amount of vertical force has to be\ngenerated. \nBased on data taken from Miller, S. and Bartlett, R, Journal of Sports Sciences,\napproximately 81% of the speed is generated by the upper body and 19% comes\nfrom extending the knee, hip and ankle. Even though only 19% of the ball speed\nis generated by using the legs, it will mean that less effort is required from the\nmuscles of the shooting arm. If a shooter has to put less effort into the shot, it is\nmore likely to be successful. \n77\nDiagram No. 4 - Direct Proportional Relationship\nForce\nHorizontal Force\nVertical Force\n\nSimilarly, in shot-put, most of the world top shot-putters now use a spinning\nmotion coupled with a strong vertical force, generated by the rapid flexing of the\nlegs, to generate maximum power. The more vertical force the shot-putter can\ngenerate, the more horizontal force is feasible, increasing the release angle\ncloser to the optimum angle. \nTo illustrate the effect of vertical force and horizontal force, try running on soft sand.\nAs the legs push against the sand to generate vertical force, the sand will give\nway and less horizontal force can be developed, resulting in less forward speed.\nBasketball, shot-put, running and any other movement sports require a more\ndynamic balance in which the stability can easily be altered, while archery\ndemands a more static balance, which has to be maintained throughout the shot.\nHowever, in archery too, being best biomechanically balanced will assist in\nestablishing a sound technique with less muscular effort. Proper body\npositioning will create less tension in the body, allowing a steadier hold and aim,\nthereby producing a flowing shot.\nIt must therefore be recognized, that the pressure distribution of 60-70% on the\nballs of the feet and 40-30% on the heels is a very important component of the\nhorizontal and vertical force distribution. Unfortunately, many Western archers\nare standing more on their heels and as such cannot achieve optimum stability. \nA direct proportional relationship between horizontal and vertical forces in\narchery cannot be shown using force plates; however, with the right posture and\nbalance, we can be stronger, develop forces more beneficially, thereby achieving\ngreater stability.\n78\nTOTAL ARCHERY"}

The elite archers were also shown\nto improve their stability during the last few seconds preceding the release,\nwhile in contrast, the lower level archers showed a significant difference in\nbalance parameters already 4-6 seconds prior to and up to release. \n4_Principle of Eye Control\nOnce more, let us look at the way some other sports do it.\nLooking at baseball, the hitter will not only try to look at the ball, but also try\nto focus on the stitching of the ball. They want to see the ball very clearly, which\ncan be further enhanced by going to a narrow external focus.\nSimilarly with tennis players, when they hit the ball, they do not look where\nthey wants the ball to land, but they focus totally on the ball to ensure proper\ntiming and impact and will not take their eyes off the ball. \nThe same goes for golfers hitting the ball. Golfers, like the tennis players, have\nmade up their mind where they want the ball to land and the distance required.\nThey then totally focus on the ball itself, right throughout the follow through. If\nthe eyes are taken off the ball to see where the ball is going, then very likely a\nmiss-hit will occur.\nEqually, in archery, the final focus has to be the target, not the sight pin and not\nthe arrow. The eyes have to stay focused on the target until the arrow hits. Many\narchers try to watch the arrow and that is why they lose control of the shot. This\n79"}

If they aim to\nrun only 100M, they will subconsciously slowdown coming to the finish line.\nSimilarly, golfers, baseball players, cricketers or tennis players have to hit\n“through” or beyond the ball and follow-through, otherwise momentum and\nvelocity is lost. Obviously, this applies to all sporting disciplines.\nIn archery, we do need to keep direction and tension during the follow-\nthrough. Keeping direction does not mean that the drawing elbow goes straight\nback in line with the arrow. The drawing elbow will have to come around\nbecause there is quite a big arc in the back tension movement. The bow arm\nwill move slightly left, due to the back tension. Refer to Chapter 6, Cl.6 SCATT\nSystem Tests.\nArchers will need to be taught how to move the Scapulae correctly together on\nrelease and maintain back tension. If the Scapulae are set too far away from the\nspine or too high, it will be difficult to develop good back tension. If the\nScapulae come more together, we are able to expand and open the chest more\nand in so doing, we can come through the clicker those last few millimeters.\n80\nTOTAL ARCHERY"}

A good example would be the World Champion swimmer Ian Thorpe;\nwatching him break world records, one can only marvel at his very relaxed style,\nalmost as if he is doing training laps. \nAnother example would be a baseball pitcher, when he pitches, he can produce\na faster ball when he pitches with more relaxed muscles. A tensed muscle is a\nmuch weaker muscle. \nSimilarly, elite level athletes have the ability to perform with the least amount\nof tension, producing the maximum amount of power.\nIn archery, we will see the top performers execute their skills in a seemingly\ntotally relaxed and effortless manner.

These “initiated” archers are \nnow ready for choosing their own archery equipment division and archery disci-\nplines; in other words, they need the assistance of a coach for getting specialized in \none type of bow (Recurve or Compound or Barebow or Traditional bow) and one \nor two archery disciplines (for instance Outdoor T arget during the warm season \nand Indoor T arget during the cold season, or Outdoor T arget and Field Archery).\nModular format\nPending the “sensibility” of his/her club, the coach will need a coaching speciali-\nzation that meet the wish of specialization of the archers he/she has to take care \nof. This is why the FITA Coaches Committee has presented this curriculum under \nvarious “modules” allowing an education “à la carte” of the level 2 archery coaches. \nFor instance a coach could have a use of the module “ Archers with Disabilities” , be-\ncause his /her club has always been open to this public due to some close relation-\nship with a rehab center for instance. Another example: a coach could have no need \nof the Compound module, or the Field Archery Module, since in his/her country, \nonly the Olympic form of archery is practiced.\nNevertheless the FITA Coaches Committee strongly suggests to all level 2 \ncoaches to pass the following modules for delivering good coaching services: “ AR-\nCHERY ANATOMY, WARM-UP and PHYSICAL CONDITIONING” – “CODE \nof ETHICS” – “FIGHT against DOPING” – “PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS of AR -\nCHERY” – “PSYCHOLOGY” and “TRAINING PLAN”\nIt will be up to the FITA Member Associations that will use the FITA Level 2 \nCoaching material to make these modules mandatory or not.\nProfile of the archers to work with\nAs already stated “ At this level 2, the coach has usually to take care of archers who \nhave completed the level 1… ” – See “Coaching Objectives” above chapter for more \ndetails.

Role of the Coach\nT o gain respect you have to give respect, and when \nyou give it make sure that it is genuine and sincere.\nCoaches play a vital role in the progressive development of \ntheir archers. How coaches communicate with the archer \nand the atmosphere they create often determines whether \nthe interactive experience is beneficial or detrimental. \nBased on this, coaches should adopt a positive approach \nto coaching. This should be based on good common sense \nand incorporate several basic principles to teach the cor -\nrect execution of the shot from the beginning.\n2.1 Give plenty of praise and encouragement. When \npeople are learning and refining newly adopted \nskills, coaches should provide plenty of genuine \npraise and encouraging statements that are related \nto the skills and performance of the archer.\n2.2 Give praise sincerely. If coaches are not sincere with \ntheir praise and encouragement, they will lose their \ncredibility with the archers they are coaching.\n2.3 Develop and produce realistic expectations. It is im-\nperative that coaches and their archers have realis -\ntic expectations that are based on each individual’s \nabilities.\n2.4 Give praise for effort as much as outcome. For some \narchers, winning events may be an unlikely achieve-\nment, but trying to succeed by giving maximum ef -\nfort is attainable by all those involved.\n2.5 Give praise for correct techniques and performance, \nnot just outcome. Coaches should remember to en-\ncourage archers to improve their skills, they should \nalso provide encouraging feedback to the archer \nwhen they have produced a good technique but are \nless than successful with the result. Winning at the \nexpense of skill development will lead to failure at \nthe more advanced levels of archery participation.\n2.6 Employ a ‘sandwich’ approach to correcting mis -\ntakes. Such an approach focuses on providing a cor-\nrective instruction sandwiched between two posi-\ntive and encouraging statements. Also by making \nthe archer aware of the mistake, is often an opening \nfor correction."}

This should include the responsibility toward \nthe archer parent and family, and colleagues of the ath-\nlete, their employer and the organisation under which \numbrella they are operating, i.e. club, county, country \nand FITA.\n2. Role of the Coach\nT o gain respect you have to give respect, and when \nyou give it make sure that it is genuine and sincere.\nCoaches play a vital role in the progressive development of \ntheir archers. How coaches communicate with the archer \nand the atmosphere they create often determines whether \nthe interactive experience is beneficial or detrimental. \nBased on this, coaches should adopt a positive approach \nto coaching. This should be based on good common sense \nand incorporate several basic principles to teach the cor -\nrect execution of the shot from the beginning.\n2.1 Give plenty of praise and encouragement. When \npeople are learning and refining newly adopted \nskills, coaches should provide plenty of genuine \npraise and encouraging statements that are related \nto the skills and performance of the archer.\n2.2 Give praise sincerely. If coaches are not sincere with \ntheir praise and encouragement, they will lose their \ncredibility with the archers they are coaching.\n2.3 Develop and produce realistic expectations. It is im-\nperative that coaches and their archers have realis -\ntic expectations that are based on each individual’s \nabilities.\n2.4 Give praise for effort as much as outcome. For some \narchers, winning events may be an unlikely achieve-\nment, but trying to succeed by giving maximum ef -\nfort is attainable by all those involved.\n2.5 Give praise for correct techniques and performance, \nnot just outcome. Coaches should remember to en-\ncourage archers to improve their skills, they should \nalso provide encouraging feedback to the archer \nwhen they have produced a good technique but are \nless than successful with the result. Winning at the \nexpense of skill development will lead to failure at \nthe more advanced levels of archery participation.\n2.6 Employ a ‘sandwich’ approach to correcting mis -\ntakes. Such an approach focuses on providing a cor-\nrective instruction sandwiched between two posi-\ntive and encouraging statements. Also by making \nthe archer aware of the mistake, is often an opening \nfor correction."}

These goals should \nbe recorded so that they can be referred to through \nthe progression of improvement and time.\n3. Dignity\nSafeguarding the dignity of the individual is a fundamen-\ntal requirement of being a coach.\nThere shall be no discrimination between participants \non the basis of race, sex, ethnic origin, religion, philo -\nsophical or political opinion, marital status or any areas \nthat would be offensive or cause an aggravation to any \nperson the coach is likely to come in contact with.\n3.1 No practice constituting any form of physical or \nmental injury to the participants will be tolerated. \nAll doping practices at all levels are strictly prohib -\nited. Any form of inducement to indulge in, or par -\ntake in, any drug abuse will be contradictory to the \nCode of Conduct for Coaches.\n3.2 All forms of harassment or abuse against participants \nor spectators; be it physical, mental, professional or \nsexual, are prohibited. \n4. Integrity in Relationships\nCoaches must not encourage archers to violate the rules \nlaid down by the official organisation/federation govern-\ning that activity. They should actively condemn any such \naction and encourage archers to adhere to, and abide by \nthe spirit of the rules.\n4.1 Coaches should not compromise their archer’s in-\ntegrity by condoning any activity that would present \nan unfair advantage. The coach must encourage and \nactively pursue measures that progressively develops \nperformance improvement in a safe and considerate \nmanor and one that which will not jeopardise the \narchers well being for future performances.\n4.2 It is the coaches’ responsibility to ensure training \nand programmes they follow are directly relevant to \nthe archer and that they are in accordance with the \nage, ability and experience of the archer and will not \ncause any incapacitation.\n4.3 The coach should be responsible for the conduct \nof their archers and must discourage any behaviour \nthat would bring them, the archer or sport into dis -\nrepute, whether this is in training, travel or competi-\ntion.\n4.4 Coaches must treat all opponents with respect \nwhether it is in victory or defeat, and should encour-\nage their archers to act similarly. It is the coaches’ \nduty to prepare their archer to respond to success \nand defeat in a cordial and dignified manner.\n4.5 Coaches must be able to present any evidence of \ndocumented qualifications on request and must not \nrefer to or display any item that falsely implies any \nsponsorship or accreditation qualifications.\n5. Professional Competence\n The coach should take the limits of their knowledge \nand capacity into account; and should not assume \nresponsibility if they are not sufficiently prepared \nfor the task at hand.\n5.1 The coach should recognise and accept when it \nis necessary or appropriate to refer their archer to \nother coaches or sport specific specialists for further \ndevelopment. It is also their responsibility, where \nappropriate, to verify the competence of the per -\nson or organisation to which they are referring their \narcher.\n5.2 Competence to coach should normally be verified \nby documented qualifications, or documented evi-\ndence of performance. Competence cannot be in-\nferred solely from prior experience. \n5.3 The coach must refrain from working in an environ-\nment that is unsafe or jeopardises the safety, or well \nbeing, of their archers or other participants. \n5.4 Coaches should actively seek ways of improving \ntheir personal and/or professional development; \nthey have a responsibility to themselves and their \narchers to improve their own ability and effective-\nness.\n6. Personal Standards\nPersonal appearance is a matter of individual preference \nand culture but a coach should project an image of clean-\nliness and efficiency; and not project an image that would \noffend either onlookers or the archers being coached."}

It may effect their \ndecisions or competence to coach and may com-\npromise the safety of the archers or spectators of the \nsession. It may also be offensive to archers to smell \nalcohol on the breath of the person they are being \ncoached by, and breathing out alcoholic fumes does \nnot portray a very good image of a coach in charge \nof an important training session.\n7. Confidentiality\nWhen a coach has a good working relationship with an \narcher it is inevitable that a great deal of confidential in-\nformation is interchanged and sometimes recorded. It \nis imperative that the coach and archer agree on which \nof this data is regarded as confidential, this confidential \ninformation must not be divulged to any person or per -\nsons without the express approval of the archer/parent \nor guardian. \nCoaches must not disclose information entrusted to \nthem in confidence. Any disclosure of information must \nnot be for personal gain or benefit, nor be undertaken \nmaliciously to damage the reputation of any person or \norganisation.\nSome person, persons or organisations may have a \nneed/right to have knowledge of some of this confiden-\ntial information. It may fall on the coach to decide wheth-\ner the disclosure of such information is in the best interest \nof the archer or sporting organisation. Some examples are \nlisted below: \nPerformance information for team or competition • \nselection.\nDisclosure of information to doctors, the athlete’s • \nparents or family where the health or safety of the \nathlete may be in jeopardy.\nDisclosure of information to protect children or vul-• \nnerable adults from abuse.\nDisclosure of information for legal or disciplinary re-• \nquirements. \n8. Coach Responsibility\nThe basis of responsible coaching carries the expectation \nthat activities carried out by coaches will be beneficial to \nthe archers they are coaching, and to the sport in which \nthey partake. The implementation of this coaching ac-\ntivity is to improve the archer’s performance and at the \nsame time minimising the risk of injury by ensuring their \nknowledge is current and all their training programmes \nare well prepared.\n8.1 The coach should recognise and acknowledge their \nlimitations and work within these limitations. They \nshould accept the responsibility to refer their archer \nto other coaches or sports specific experts who have \nmore advanced knowledge than them selves, and \nwork with these people to enhance their archer’s \nwell being and/or performance.\n8.2 The coach should strive to enhance their knowledge \nand coaching skills through research and personal \nlearning projects, and to ensure their training pro -\ngrammes enhance their archer’s well being and/or \nperformance and does not harm or hinder them in \nany way.\n8.3 The coach must be responsible for their archer or team \nand themselves in the pursuit of professional compe-\ntence both in training and competition through well \nbalanced and appropriate training programmes.\n8.4 The coach must ensure that all training exercises and \ntraining programmes are appropriate for the person \nthey have been designed for, and take into considera-\ntion, age, health, ability and experience of that per -\nson.\n8.5 The coach must take into consideration the individ-\nuality and ability of each team member when con-\nstructing training exercises or training programmes.\n8.6 The coach must constantly monitor their archer’s \nphysical and mental condition and take the nec-\nessary or appropriate action, and to take this into \nconsideration when overseeing training exercises or \nconstructing training programmes.\n8.7 The coach must be aware of every day pressures the \narcher may have, such as; educational, occupational, \nand family or financial, and adapt their actions, in-\nstructions and training programmes accordingly.\n8.8 The coach must consider the archer’s well being \nand future development when making decisions on \nwhether the archer can continue competing if suffer-\ning from a minor injury, fatigue or minor ailment. It is \nimperative that the well being and future development \nof the archer are put before current performance."}

Same example, the biceps muscle is \nlocated on the front side of the elbow joint, thus it will \nbend this joint to the front. \nObviously, there must be muscles on the opposite side \nof that joint to bring the bones back to their original posi-\ntion or move bones to the opposite side. In our example \nthis would be the triceps muscle which is located on the \nposterior side of the upper limb, thus it will stretch out \nthe bent elbow (bending to the back side is not possible \ndue to the shape of the elbow joint). \nMuscles which perform movement in opposite direc-\ntions of another muscle are called antagonists, whereas \nmuscles that help together for a certain movement are \ncalled synergists. If a single muscle (agonist) is contracted \nthe antagonist has to relax and vice versa. If that does not \nwork properly it will result in cramps where (almost) no \nintended movement can be achieved. \nT o be able to stand straight or to keep our body in a bal-\nanced posture, no matter if standing or lying down, mus -\ncles have a certain basic tension which can consciously be \ninfluenced and altered. If, through exercises, one muscle \nis well trained the antagonist will become relatively too \nweak; such an imbalance is then followed by a change in \nthe usual joint posture. Knowing this, we should always \nrecommend strengthening not only the agonist but also \nthe antagonist, as well as symmetrically both sides of the \nbody, to keep the balance. \nFor archery, our main concern points towards bones, \njoints and muscles of the shoulder girdle. Although a lot \nof different anatomical structures are listed and described \nbelow they do not work isolated but cooperate in several \nways, depending on different joint positions. \nThe basis of the shoulder girdle is built up by the up -\nper part of the chest cavity (consisting out of spine, ribs \nand sternum), shoulder blade and clavicle (see picture be-\nlow, seen from top of a human being). \nArising from the shoulder blade we have the socket for \nthe upper arm to build the shoulder joint. This joint is, \ndue to a rather flat socket, very generously constructed to \nprovide a maximum range of movements for the arm. It \nis possible to raise the arm sideways (we call that abduc-\ntion) almost to the horizontal level without involving any \nmovement of the shoulder blade itself. Further abduction \nneeds movement of the shoulder blade as the upper arm \nis pushing against the acromion (highest and most out -\nward point of the shoulder blade). Dislocation of the up-\nper arm out of the socket at such generous movements is \navoided through the rotator cuff, a strong capsule around \nthe joint. The rotator cuff will be held under tension \nthrough the supraspinatus muscle so that it cannot be \nsqueezed through the bone structures during movement, \nparticularly on abduction."}

Important muscles of the shoulder girdle and the \nback\nWe distinguish several muscle layers between skin and rib \ncage where the bigger and larger ones more or less cover \nthe smaller ones; it should also be kept in mind that mus-\ncles very rarely work on their own, a movement mostly \ninvolves several muscles at the same time, sometimes \nthey achieve different movements when a joint between \ntwo bones has changed its position.\nLike describing different positions with special names \nwe also have special names for describing certain move-\nments in anatomy; they are:\n– Abduction: away from the body to the side; example, \nraising the bow arm to the side; \n– Adduction: towards the body, coming from the side; \nexample, the opposite of the above;\n– Ante version: away from the body to the front; \n– Retroversion: away from the body to the back;\n– inward rotation: explains itself;\n– Outward rotation: explains itself.\n– Deltoid muscle: it covers the shoulder joint like a cap, \nits origin goes from the spine of the shoulder blade \nover the acromion to the clavicle; it inserts at the prox-\nimal end of the upper arm. \nMain movements: abduction (the strongest muscle to \ndo that), inward and outward rotation (depending what \npart of the muscle is activated).\n– Supraspinatus muscle: originates in the groove over \nthe spine of the shoulder blade and inserts also at the \nproximal part of the upper arm.\n Movements: it mainly prevents a squeezing of the ro -\ntator cuff during abduction of the arm, and helps a lit-\ntle for this movement. \n– Infraspinatus muscle: originates at the area below the \nspine of the shoulder blade and inserts also at the up -\nper arm.\nMovement: the strongest outward rotator of the arm. \n– Major T eres muscle: originates at the lowest medial \nand posterior part of the shoulder blade and inserts \nalso at the proximal upper arm.\nMovement: inward rotation, adduction, retroversion\n– Minor teres muscle: coming also from the posterior \nmedial part of the shoulder blade and going to the \nproximal part of the upper arm.\nMovement: inward rotator.\n– Subscapular muscle: originates from the frontal side \nof the shoulder blade and inserts at the proximal part \nof the upper arm.\n Movement: the strongest inward rotator; it also pre-\nvents squeezing of the rotator cuff. \n– Serratus anterior muscle: originates from the 1\nst to the \n9th rib, passing alongside the chest cavity and inserts at \nthe medial frontal edge of the shoulder blade."}

At the same time the rhomboid \nmuscles as well as the trapezoid muscle as antagonists \nhave to be relaxed (therefore no squeezing of the \nshoulder blade towards the spine on the bow side). T o \nprevent the shoulder from becoming “high” , mainly \nthe latissimus dorsi muscle is activated. Major and mi-\nnor teres muscle, as well as subscapular muscle rotate \nthe arm inwards which prevents the elbow and fore-\narm from being touched by the string on release (thus \nit is a rotation in the shoulder joint which brings the \nelbow out of the way of the string; the elbow itself can \njust be bent or stretched). The minor pectoral muscle \nmoves the shoulder girdle of that side up to a certain \nextent more to the front so that the centre of the shoul-\nder joint (“ A” in the picture below) comes closer to the \nline between anchor point and pivot point at the bow \nhandle (“B” – “C” in the picture below); this alleviates \nthe back muscles their work in compensating for the \nforce vector created in this latter line (B – C); twisting \nthe trunk a little clockwise (seen from top; with right-\nhanded archers) can even increase this mechanism \nfrom a physical point of view, because the line through \nthe centre of both shoulder joints gets more parallel to \nthe line A – B, thus giving relief to the back muscles for \ntheir work against the force coming from B. \nBeginner archers tend to bring the bow shoulder too \nmuch to the front without sufficient inward rotation of \ntheir bow arm, thus suffering from painful hits of the \nstring on the elbow.\nb) The string side: Biceps (for the elbow bend) and ma-\njor pectoral muscle bring the arm towards the string \nso that the fingers (with or without mechanical re-\nlease) can take hold of it; at the same time the deltoid \nmuscle (and to a minor degree also the supraspinatus \nmuscle which mainly prevents the rotator cuff from \nbeing squeezed in between acromion and most prox-\nimal end of the upper arm) is activated so that this \nhappens in an approximate horizontal level. (The ac-\ntivities of the finger muscles and where they are locat-\ned is described below in the next paragraph). T o pull \nthe string back to the anchor point several muscles are \nnow working together: the trapezoid and rhomboid \nmuscles move the shoulder blade towards the spine, \nmainly the posterior part of the deltoid muscle and \nthe infraspinatus muscle lead the upper arm back -\nwards so that the elbow comes as close as possible to \nthe extension of line B – C (see picture above). The \nmiddle part of the deltoid muscle keeps the drawing \narm in the horizontal level or above. While pulling the \nstring back and coming to full draw the muscles situ-\nated on the back side of the shoulder joint are holding \nagainst the draw weight of the bow, also the muscles \nwhich bend the fingers must work as otherwise the \nstring or a hand-held release would slip out of them, \nas well as part of the biceps muscle and a few smaller \nmuscles. \nT o overcome the peak weight some compound archers \nmove their elbow closer to the trunk and downwards. \nThey do this instinctively to use additional muscles and \nto strengthen the pulling muscles in using a more effective \nposition. The peak weight has to be overcome in a rather \nunfavourable position for the shoulder joint and muscles. \nThe angle between upper arm and the line through both \nshoulder joints has not yet reached 90°, so that the mus -\ncles which have to pull further are still much elongated \nand have to battle with a long lever (upper arm) as well \nas a poor physical relationship between their origin and \ninsert. In bringing the elbow closer to the trunk firstly the \nlever situation of the pulling muscles is improved and sec-\nondly the strong biceps muscle assists to overcome the \npeak. This simple trick helps to pull further back but is \nbad form. Moreover, the hand holding the release will be \nmoved downwards, and whilst the bow hand is still keep-\ning its position, this could have a disastrous effect: in case \nthe string loop or the rope of the release would break just \nin this moment the arrow would be shot way over the tar-"}

So, not to run any risk, \nwe should either teach such archers to do special muscle \nexercises to become capable of pulling the string back in a \nhorizontal level or we should convince them of reducing \ntheir draw weight.\nDifferences between recurve and compound archers \nat full draw:\nWhen just simulating the position at full draw the back of \nthe hand normally would point upwards. \n– With recurve archers the hand has to be twisted out -\nward (so-called supination) which is achieved by a \nsmall muscle called supinator muscle (situated at the \ntwo bones of the forearm near the elbow joint) which \nis assisted by the biceps muscle.\n – When shooting a wrist-strap release these muscles are \nrelaxed as the back of the hand is in its natural posi-\ntion.\n– When shooting a hand-held release normally the \nhand is rotated inwards (so-called pronation) to bring \nthe back of the hand with its knuckles towards the jaw \nbone. This action is done by two small muscles namely \npronator teres and pronator quadratus muscle. Obvi-\nously, the biceps muscle has to be relaxed to make this \ninward rotation possible. \nThe above said shall serve as just a rough description \nwhat happens with arm and shoulder muscles when per -\nforming a shot. Also other muscles of the trunk come into \nplay but don‘t have such a big role in that game. \n3. Other muscles used in archery\na) Muscles of the neck: in the neck area we have a \nlot of small muscles which provide for turning the \nface towards the target, but (to keep it as simple as \npossible) the main rotator muscle of the head shall \nbe mentioned, this is the sternocleidomastoid mus -\ncle; it originates at the sternum and medial part of \nthe clavicle, its insertion is at the lower back side of \nthe head, the so-called occiput. T ension of the right \nsternocleidomastoid muscle turns the head to the \nleft and vice versa.\nb) Muscles of fingers and hand: There is a whole \nbundle of muscles coming from the elbow and con-\nverges towards the hand and fingers. These are the \nmajor muscles for moving fingers and wrist joint. Of \ncourse, there are several others more, smaller mus -\ncles which originate at the proximal end of the fin-\ngers and metacarpus, and insert at their most distal \nend. In general, all muscles located on the palm-side \nof the hand bend the fingers; those situated on the \nback-side of the hand will stretch them. \nc) Deep grip versus shallow grip (release hand): \nwhen holding the string at full draw: holding the \nstring with just the finger tips needs an extreme ten-\nsion of those muscles bending the fingers, otherwise \nthe string would slip away before it should. The release \nthen happens out of a very tensed condition; in con-\ntrast, using a deep finger grip the lever between the \nfinger joints becomes more effective, thus needs less \ntension. Although the way of the string around the \nentire end part of the holding fingers is now longer, \nthe release happens out of a much less tensed status \nand therefore will be smooth, see picture below.\nd) High grip versus low grip (bow hand): if the \nbow hand is kept relaxed the archer will per -\nform a low grip where the thumb ball is pressed \nagainst the grip of the handle. The tension in this \nball may vary from day to day, depending on the \noverall physical condition on a day; if that con-\ndition is good, the tension will also be good and \nvice versa. With a poor tension in this ball the \n“way through the clicker” might become long-\ner and longer. In compound archery this issue \ndoes not play a role as they normally do not use \na clicker. Also, with a low grip the pressure point \nis further away from the arrow rest.\nShould the archer decide for a high grip they additionally \nhave to apply tension on those muscles which bend the \nwrist joint. This tension has to be kept equally from shot to \nshot which needs a lot of practise to achieve that. Moreo-\nver, all other muscles which can move the wrist joint have \nto be tensed in order to stabilize the wrist joint during the \nwhole shot performance. With a high grip the pressure \npoint is closer to the arrow rest (see x-ray pictures below)."}

The fingers open passively, this \nis not an active opening of fingers; it is as if a bucket \nfull of water or sand is just incidentally slipping out \nof the tensed fingers. Super slow motion pictures have \nshown that the fingers are almost immediately slightly \nbent again when the string has moved forward just a \nfew centimetres. \n– Compound archers may use two ways of getting the \ntrigger going: \nI. They keep a certain tension in their trigger finger to \nform it like a stiff hook; then they increase back ten-\nsion and pull more and more against the wall until the \ntrigger goes; if a wrist-strap release is used the strap \nwill squeeze the skin and slide slightly towards the \nwrist joint; thus the stiff trigger finger is moved to -\nwards the trigger of the mechanical release and finally \ngets it going. With a hand-held release, for example a \nthumb release, most probably the fingers holding the \nmechanical release will open slightly or, also thinka-\nble, the capsule (soft tissue) around the wrist joint and \nthe capsule around the joints between holding fingers \nand metacarpus will be elongated a little to enable the \nstiff trigger finger to move towards the trigger of the \nmechanical release. Most top archers prefer this way \nof using a mechanical release. What really happens (is \nthere a subconscious movement of the trigger finger \nor not?) is still to be examined and sorted out by neu-\nrological research.\nII. Another way to use a mechanical release is to keep up \nback tension and use the trigger finger, no matter if \nwrist-strap release or hand-held release is used, like a \nrifle shooter, shall mean consciously bend this trigger \nfinger on purpose when everything is done right and \nthe archer feels ready to let go.\ne) Muscles of the legs and buttocks:\nThe main muscles are the gluteus maximus muscle, quad-\nriceps femoris muscle, biceps femoris muscle, triceps \nsurae muscle, anterior tibialis muscle and several others \nsmaller muscles which should not expressively be men-\ntioned in this manual.\nObviously, these muscles help together in achieving a \nfirm stance, tighten the joints of the lower leg. \nf ) Some coaches recommend a square (classic) stance, \nothers an open one. Human beings are extremely"}

The square stance \nneeds the least effort in muscle activities. \nLet’s imagine a person standing relaxed in upright po-\nsition in front of us; if we draw a line through the centre of \nthe hip joint, the knee joint as well as the ankle joint then \nthis line would be perfectly straight (it is called “Miku-\nlicz line”); of course, this is valid for both legs in a healthy \nperson. If we draw then another line through the centre of \nboth hip joints the angle between this line and the Miku-\nlicz line is 90° on either side, and finally, the spine is rest -\ning again in a 90° angle on the centre of this horizontal \nhip line. \nAs seen from the side also a straight line would run \nthrough the ankle joint, hip joint and through the ear up \nto the vertex. The weight distribution is approximately \n60-70% on the heel, 30-40% on the front foot. This per -\nson’s stance is then in complete balance with almost no \nmuscular effort. Bringing the feet “shoulder width” apart \nwould increase the area of stance, thus making it more \nstable without any extra strain.\nThe balance of this stance will be slightly disturbed by \nholding a weight of about 2 kg (the bow with accessories) \non the stretched out, abducted arm. This will bring more \nload to the leg of the bow side, the trunk tends to get bent \nto the bow side, thus the trunk muscles of the string side \nhave to compensate for that imbalance. The main muscles \nto achieve that reach from the hip bone and run more or \nless parallel to the spine up to the neck have several ori-\ngins and insertions on their way; they belong to the so-\ncalled longitudinal muscle system of the back, represent \nthe deepest layer of back muscles. Obviously, these mus-\ncles are also important in field archery with uphill and/\nor downhill shots to achieve the necessary bending of the \ntrunk to keep the shoulder girdle in line with the target.\nWith an open stance the situation is completely dif -\nferent as there is extra muscle strain to bring the body \nout of balance on purpose. The top part of the trunk, the \nshoulder girdle, cannot be rotated (or just very slightly), \nthus the position of the shoulder blades and arms stays \nthe same as with the classic square stance (they are in \nline towards the target). Y et, the location of the feet has \nbeen changed, so there must be a rotation of the body \nin between the feet and the shoulder girdle. All joints \nlocated in between will be involved as the body always \nstrives for harmonic balancing of any imbalance. There \nwill be a slight rotation in the ankle joints and knee joints, \nmore rotation is possible in the hip joint of both sides as \nwell as in the little joints between the lumbar vertebrae \n(the ribs prevent major rotation in the chest region of \nthe spine). The rotation causes asymmetric strain on \nligaments around and cartilages in the joints. Mostly, the \narchers also lean their upper body forward which leads to \na weight distribution of 60-70% on the front of the foot” \nand 30-40% on the heels.\nDeep back muscles (left) and their force vectors (right.)\nIn theory it is thinkable that the inward rotation of the \nbow arm (remember latissimus dorsi muscle above) is \nsupported by an open stance as through the body rota-\ntion this muscle becomes a little elongated (the upper \npart of the chest cavity rotates away from the hip bone \non the bow side), thus more effective. So far, there is no \nproof but should be considered possible that this way of \nstanding has negative effects on the skeleton (towards a"}

Warm-up exercises\nIn archery we usually don’t have a lot of movement dur -\ning a competition. Our sport is considered to be static. \nTherefore it is recommendable to do warm-up exercises \nto compensate at least partly for the side effects of long \nlasting standing. \nEffective warm-up exercises increase the body’s ca-\npabilities, performance in training and competition will \nbecome better. Through warm-up exercises the circula-\ntory system, bones and joints, as well as the muscles are \nprepared for the coming stress, not to forget the positive \neffect on the psyche in reducing anxiety and possible lack \nof self-confidence ahead of a coming event. \nMoving larger muscle groups in warming-up exercises \nincreases the body temperature, blood will be drawn out \nof the digestive system (that’s why you should not prac-\ntise or compete right after a meal), the blood vessels will \nbe widened, thus the circulatory situation in the muscles \nas well as in the brain will improve thus more oxygen is \navailable. Improving the circulation is particularly neces -\nsary to prevent trouble with the veins as the blood flow \nnormally slows down during long lasting standing.\nWith increased body temperature resistances within the \ndifferent tissues will be decreased, the archer will be able to \nstretch better, to tense their muscles better, and to get more \nstamina. Stretching exercises will increase the range of mo-\ntions. Outside the shooting range jogging, swimming, cy-\ncling, dancing, stepping or cross walking are recommend-\nable exercises. On the shooting range the facilities for us-\ning machines are limited; therefore warming-up should be \nkept as simple but also as effective as possible.\nThe following exercises shall be considered a sugges -\ntion; everyone may change them or include different ex -\nercises in their own program; where possible all following \nexercises should be done on both sides:\n– Jogging on the spot, alternating slowly and quick; side \njumps with both legs to the right and left.\n– T ake a long step forward with one foot, bend the knee \nof the front leg, and stretch the back leg out straight \nbehind you as far as possible, keeping the heel on the \nground. \n– Standing in upright stance, arms stretched out above \nthe head, holding on to one thumb and stretching over \nthe other side.\n– standing on both legs, keeping your thighs together, \nbend one leg in the knee, take hold of the foot in front \nof the ankle, hand and foot pulling against each other; \nfeeling the stretch in the thigh\n– standing in upright stance; arms stretched out to your \nside shoulder level, alternating palms facing down and \npalms facing up (shoulder rotation)\n– Stand with your legs fairly wide apart, feet parallel, \ntwisting in the hips bringing the upper body over one \nleg to reach the calf or the ankle with the hands.\n– Standing in upright stance; left arm stretched out to -\nwards the ceiling, right arm is bent in the elbow, right \nhand holds on to the left elbow, gently pulling the left \narm behind the head.\n– Standing with the legs fairly wide apart, feet paral-\nlel, reach down with the hands to the floor, making \nsweeping motions in front of you from side to side.\n– Standing in upright stance; keeping arms loose at your \nsides, rolling the shoulders forward and backwards.\n– standing in upright stance; turn the head to the right, \nthen to the left, then bring the chin towards the chest, \nlift the chin up until you see the ceiling; then bring the \nright ear towards the right shoulder and then left ear \ntowards the left shoulder. Never combine these three \nseparate motions into one uncontrolled circulation to \navoid harm for the cervical spine.\n– Standing in upright stance; arms stretched out in front \nof you shoulder level, alternating a fist and a stretch in \nthe fingers.\n– Standing in upright stance; hands in front of your \nchest, fingers interlaced, bending and stretching both \nwrist joints alternatively.\n– Standing in upright stance, firmly on only one leg; cir-\nculate the foot of the other leg in the ankle joint, start \nwith clockwise and change then to counter-clockwise \nmotion. \n– Close with a final jogging on the spot.\nIII. Simple exercises for the shoulder girdle\n1. General\nMuscle exercises will increase the basic strength of mus -\ncles, improve the speed of contraction, and also increase \nthe local and dynamic endurance. After a certain period \nof exercises the amount of contractile proteins (Actin, \nMyosin) will be increased so that the maximum strength \nper cm² will also increase. \nBasically, there are four ways of building up muscle \nstrength, either isometric or dynamic (or isotonic), ec-"}
{"id": "Coaching_Manual_Level2-0022", "source": "Coaching_Manual_Level2.pdf", "chunk_index": 21, "page_start": 32, "page_end": 32, "text": "Archery Anatomy, Warm-Up, and Physical Conditioning 11\ncentric and isokinetic. The most important ones for our \npurposes are isometric and dynamic. With isometric ex -\nercises there is no change in the position of a joint, the \nexercise consists out of an attempt to move something. \nFor example, to build up the biceps muscle the trainee sits \nin front of an extremely heavy table and tries to lift it up. \nThe biceps muscle will be tensed at its maximum, but the \ntable can’t be moved. These exercises should be held for \nsome seconds. If held for too long the energy supply in \nthe muscle cells will become uneconomic, thus muscle \nsore will result but not necessarily increase of strength. \nThe ability to hold a certain weight or load for a certain \ntime depends on the maximum muscle strength. Is the \nload not more than 15% of what could be held at the most, \nit could be held more or less in eternity. Is the load in-\ncreased to 40% it can only be held up to about 2 minutes. \nThe reason for this decrease in time is that the blood (and \nthus oxygen) supply of the muscle decreases due to an \nincrease in pressure inside the muscle fibres. The maxi-\nmum effect in isometric muscle exercises will be achieved \nwhen approximately 70 – 80% of the maximum muscle \nstrength is used and held for not longer than 6 – 7 sec-\nonds (alternatively: maximum load held 3 – 4 seconds); \nit is enough to do 3 – 5 such contractions per muscle per \nday. An advantage of the isometric exercises is that every \nmuscle group can be built up according to our needs, and \nsuch exercises take just a few minutes per day. \nIn dynamic (or isotonic) exercises there is a move-\nment, the position of a joint will be changed. Again an \nexample for the biceps muscle: try to lift a heavy dumb \nbell just by alternatively bending and stretching the elbow \njoint. For isotonic exercises we normally recommend 12 \nrepetitions and three sets of 12 repetitions with a break \nof 1 – 2 minutes in between. An advantage of the isotonic \nmuscle exercises is that at the same time coordination is \nalso improved as there is movement during contraction \nand relaxation.\n2. Special exercises\nThrough the general knowledge we now have in anatomy \nsimple but effective exercises to improve the strength \nof muscles of the shoulder girdle may be derived. Some \narchers are using a so-called “Thera-Band” or even the \nstronger “Deuser-Band” , however, they don’t have a suita-\nble grip and they seem to be too easy for a healthy person \nto improve the muscle strength needed in top archery. Us-\ning dumb bells needs additional equipment like a bench \nor similar otherwise it would get rather tricky to train up \nfor example the back muscles. Some archers are using ma-\nchines in fitness rooms on a regular basis which is, in prin-\nciple, a good idea. However, it is the archery coaches’ and \nnot the responsibility of any owner of such centres to sort \nout exactly the necessary exercises for their students. \nBesides, there are so-called chest expanders on the \nmarket available with which very efficient exercises to \nstrengthen the shoulder girdle are possible. These ex -\npanders normally have five (rubber) strings in between \ntwo grips and provide for a wide range of exercises. They \ncome out in different strengths, from 20kg up to 100kg, \nthus using for example just two strings on a 20kg expand-\ner will give you 8kg, and the same number of strings on \na 100kg expander would then have 40kg at full draw. For \na start the student should use as many strings as they can \nhandle the exercises 2 – 3 times rather quickly but feels \nstrain coming up thereafter. Working with expanders can \nbe done everywhere, is cheap and still very effective.\nThe following program demonstrates seven simple ex-\nercises to increase muscle strength for the shoulder girdle; \nagain, this shall just serve as a suggestion, everyone is wel-\ncome to create new, helpful exercises. It is indicated if these \nexercises are isometric or dynamic so everyone may derive \nthe number of contractions and duration of training.\na. Side push-ups (dynamic): this exercise is particularly \nstrengthening the anterior serratus muscle. Place your \nfeet against a wall or cupboard; the bow hand shall be \nplaced firmly on the floor, the whole body as well as \nthe elbow of the bow arm should be kept straight dur-\ning this exercise; let the shoulder blade move towards \nthe spine (simulating a high shoulder) and “push” it \naway from the spine alternatively. See figure 1.\nFigure 1\nb.

Introduction:\nBarebow archery and recurve archery are much alike, \ntherefore in this barebow module we concentrate on those \nelements of archery that are typical for barebow and refer \nfor the common elements to the recurve module.\nThe barebow is defined for competition by FITA rules. \n(FITA Constitution and Rules, book 4, Chapter 9.3). It \ncan be described as a bow that is shot without any extra-\nneous equipment such as sight, sight marks on the bow, \ndraw check indicators etc. Archers who want to shoot a \nbarebow must realize that barebow is mainly shot in the \nFITA disciplines Field, 3D, 3DI and that barebow is not \nan Olympic discipline. There are indoor and outdoor \ncompetitions for barebow.\nShooting a barebow is a good start for novices in the \nsport of archery. Beginners will without any instruction, \nmost probably draw the bow and aim along the arrow, \nwhich is acceptable in the beginning of their learning. Af-\nter a while they will notice that there is more than just \ndrawing, aiming and release, especially when they shoot \nat different distances. In different parts of the world \nshooting traditional bows, with aiming over the arrow, is \npart of the culture.\nBarebow archers develop a good feeling for their bow \nand can later switch to a recurve or a compound bow if \nthey want to. Shooting a barebow is more and more ac-\ncepted as a learning process for beginners. In some coun-\ntries, for example Sweden, beginners in archery shoot a \nfew months with the barebow, to learn every aspect of \nshooting, with a feeling for the bow. After the barebow in-\ntroduction they make their choice for any discipline they \nwish to pursue.\nInstinctive shooting is a special method for using a \nbarebow. It is achieved by focusing on the target and re-\nleasing the arrow without any conscious attempt to calcu-\nlate the distance to the target; the shot is executed with a \nminimum of conscious visual references, such as locating \nthe arrow point at a specific place of the target face pend-\ning the shooting distance.

Introduction:\nBarebow archery and recurve archery are much alike, \ntherefore in this barebow module we concentrate on those \nelements of archery that are typical for barebow and refer \nfor the common elements to the recurve module.\nThe barebow is defined for competition by FITA rules. \n(FITA Constitution and Rules, book 4, Chapter 9.3). It \ncan be described as a bow that is shot without any extra-\nneous equipment such as sight, sight marks on the bow, \ndraw check indicators etc. Archers who want to shoot a \nbarebow must realize that barebow is mainly shot in the \nFITA disciplines Field, 3D, 3DI and that barebow is not \nan Olympic discipline. There are indoor and outdoor \ncompetitions for barebow.\nShooting a barebow is a good start for novices in the \nsport of archery. Beginners will without any instruction, \nmost probably draw the bow and aim along the arrow, \nwhich is acceptable in the beginning of their learning. Af-\nter a while they will notice that there is more than just \ndrawing, aiming and release, especially when they shoot \nat different distances. In different parts of the world \nshooting traditional bows, with aiming over the arrow, is \npart of the culture.\nBarebow archers develop a good feeling for their bow \nand can later switch to a recurve or a compound bow if \nthey want to. Shooting a barebow is more and more ac-\ncepted as a learning process for beginners. In some coun-\ntries, for example Sweden, beginners in archery shoot a \nfew months with the barebow, to learn every aspect of \nshooting, with a feeling for the bow. After the barebow in-\ntroduction they make their choice for any discipline they \nwish to pursue.\nInstinctive shooting is a special method for using a \nbarebow. It is achieved by focusing on the target and re-\nleasing the arrow without any conscious attempt to calcu-\nlate the distance to the target; the shot is executed with a \nminimum of conscious visual references, such as locating \nthe arrow point at a specific place of the target face pend-\ning the shooting distance. This form of archery can be \nquite accurate, but takes time to master. The concentra-\ntion required for this form of archery is not conducive to \nthe shooting of the number of arrows shot in major tour-\nnaments. Barebow archers rarely use Instinctive shooting \nin competition.\n2. Equipment\nAccording to FITA rules the un-braced barebow has to \nfit through a ring of 12.2 cm diameter. Stabilizers are al-\n1.

Metal or carbon recurve risers are allowed for \nbarebow, any colour is permitted, even camouflage. It is \nrecommended that the sight window is squared and high \nenough to support ‘gap shooting’ .\nIt is not allowed to have marks of any kind that may \nassist with sighting, in the sight window. The configura-\ntion of the cut-out of the window as seen by the archer at \nfull draw should not show a ‘protrusion’ that can be used \nas a sighting aid.\nAdditional mass may be added to the riser to stabilize \nthe bow. Some risers are manufactured with fixing points \nin the lower section to enable the attachment of weights. \nThe same result can be achieved if mass is added directly \nto the riser if the bow does not have such fixing points. \nT orque Flight Compensators may be mounted directly to \nthe lower part of the riser.\nT o determine the right balance of a barebow, so that \nafter the shot the upper bow limb does not move towards \nthe archer.\nThe initial rotation of an un-\nstabilised bow is the top limb \nrotates toward the archer.\nIt is advised that the archer applies, with tape, some lead \n(as used in fishing) on the lower part on the back of the \nbow handle at the designated place. Now shoot some ar -\nrows at different distances and watch the performance of \nthe bow. By adding or decreasing the weight of lead the \narcher can determine the extra mass that needs to be put \nin place to stabilize the bow; but when mounted the un-\nbraced bow must be able to pass through a 12.2 cm ring.\n2.2 Grip\nT ake care that the bow grip has no contact beyond the \nlife-line of the archer‘s hand (no contact at the side of the \nlittle finger). There is generally no sliding of the grip to ei-\nther side; the hand pushes towards the pressure point, the \nbow should leave the palm of the hand straight forward. \nLeave it up to the archer‘s feeling of comfort whether they \nchoose a high, a low or a medium grip. Y ou can resize the \ngrip or even make a new (wooden) one.\nCover the bow grip with Vaseline, have the archer \nshoot and check to see if their hand is sliding sideward. If \nthat happens, add a layer of material to the corresponding \nplace or scrape away on the opposite side. It is normal that \nthe archer’s hand moves towards the throat of the bow.\nIf we put extra material to the grip, thus making it \nmore suitable to our way of gripping, we are in danger \nthat slight inconsistencies in positioning the wrist joint \nwill change the groupings.\n2.3 Limbs\nIt is not allowed to have marks that could be of use in \naiming, on the front side (inside) of the limbs. Barebow \nlimbs should be ‘stiff ’ , to maximize side stability, so that \nthe bow will not dance around on release. The following \nfigure gives you an idea of the differences in limbs.\nMaterial Speed of Limb Draw Feeling\nWood Very slow Very weak\nWood/Fibreglass Slow Weak\nWood/Carbon Fast Weak to hard\nWood/Ceramic Fast Weak to hard\nWood/Carbon/\nCeramic Very fast Hard"}

The \ncentre serving should not have markings for aiming. The \nheavier the string (the more strands) or the heavier the \ncentre serving (double serving), the slower the string. \nThe top of the centre serving may not exceed eye height; \notherwise it could be construed as being used as a meas -\nuring aid.\n2.5 Button (Plunger)\nAny kind of adjustable pressure button is allowed as long \nas the pressure point is not placed any further back than \n2 cm (inside) from the throat of the handle (pressure \npoint). The pressure button is set up exactly the same as \nfor a “freestyle recurve bow” .\n2.6 Arrow Rest\nUse a strong arrow rest. An arrow rest needs to be reliable \nand sturdy for barebow archery. Most standard flip rests \nare robust enough to withstand the pressure the arrow \nputs on the rest at short distances when string walking. \nAt longer distances (like 50 metres) there is little influ-\nence of the arrow rest on the arrow flight. The draw point \nis close to the arrow; the arrow leaves the string close to a \nstraight line and will have sufficient ‘clearance’ while pass-\ning the arrow rest.\nAt shorter distances (like 30 metres) the archer’s fin-\ngers are placed low on the string, away from the arrow, \nwhich will create downward pressure of the arrow on the \narrow rest. On release the arrow may ‘jump’ from the rest. \nA thick support arm (more than 1.5 mm diameter) causes \nthe arrow to ‘jump’ even higher.\nBad clearance causes bad grouping. With a long sup -\nport arm of the arrow rest, there is chance that the fletch-\ning (or even the nock) makes contact with the arrow rest. \nHence, the arrow rest support arm position is critical to \nachieve good clearance.\nNock an arrow on the string and lay it on the arrow \nrest. Shorten or adjust the arrow rest support arm, so that \nthe end of the wire is not visible outside of the arrow shaft \nwhen observed from an overhead view.\nNot Correct Correct\n2.7 Nocking points and arrow nocks\nAll types of nocking points are allowed – Some com-\nmercially available nock locators have the advantage of \nconsistent thickness, but they can tend to break and are \nnot suitable to fit thicker strings. When using the nock -\ning points/arrow nocks combination, the angle between \nthe string and the arrow doesn’t play a role, but the arrow \nnocks of this arrangement are easily damaged by hits of \nother arrows on the target. T ake care to have an adequate \nspare supply; special nocks may not be readily available at \nall archery outlets.\nWhen the arrow is shot from between the index and \nsecond finger (Mediterranean release), the arrow is more \nor less perpendicular to the string. When shooting with \nthree fingers under the arrow, the arrow takes up a sharp \nangle with the upper part of the string. We can use two \nnocking points to avoid the arrow nock sliding down \nthe string. Two nocking points on the string should be \nmounted far enough apart to avoid pinching the arrow \nbetween the nocking points."}

The theory behind bare-shaft \ntuning is that a bare shaft will continue to fly in the direc-\ntion it was launched from the bow. Shoot at least three \nfletched arrows and two un-fletched arrows at targets at \n15 and 30 metres. The 15 metres will cover the short dis -\ntances whereas the 30 meters is just over half of the long-\nest distance for the barebow discipline Field Archery. It is \nimportant that the coach watches that the archer shoots \nidentical shots, especially with the same finger position \non string and facial location.\nIf the un-fletched shafts impact above the fletched \nshafts, the nock point is too low, if the un-fletched shafts \nimpact below the fletched shafts, the nock point is too \nhigh. It is sometimes desirable to have the bare shaft im-\npact just slightly below the fletched shafts to ensure that \nthe nock point is not too low, as this could cause clear -\nance problems. It could also be considered in having the \nbare shaft impact slightly to the left of the fletched group \nto compensate for the string reflex.\n2.8 Arrows\nArchers can shoot any kind of arrows with the barebow \nbut they have to be aware that they should be able to \nreach 50 metres under comfortable sighting conditions. \nWith this in mind an archer who intends to shoot alu-\nminium arrows should have a bow with a draw weight of \naround 45 lbs. With medium weight aluminium/carbon \narrows the draw weight should be around 42 lbs. With \nlight weight aluminium/carbon arrows a bow of 35 lbs \nshould be sufficient to reach the required distance with \nease. These suggestions will depend on the archers draw \nlength – with the longer the draw length the power stroke \nwill be longer; this will impart greater power into the \nlaunch of the arrow.\nSee the selection chart from your manufacturer, or re-\nfer to an Arrow Flight Simulator program commercially \navailable for use on personal computers.\nIt is recommended for beginners to start with arrows, \nwhich are longer than the measured draw length, because \nafter a few months of intense practice the draw length \ncould increase up to one inch or more, due to the strength-\nened muscles of the shoulder girdle and better use of the \nchest cavity through good breathing techniques. Accord-\ningly, the arrows chosen should be one or even two spine \nvalues stiffer than recommended in preparation for the \nincrease in draw length.\n2.9 T ab\nThe purpose of a tab is to protect the fingers. A smooth \ntab with a uniform surface reduces the friction with the \nstring and affects a clean release. The smoother the tab, \nthe weaker the arrow reacts. Bad surface texture of a tab \ncan result in differences in dynamic spine. A little talcum \npowder on the tab ensures a smooth surface, and extends \nthe life of the tab.\nIn contrast to the tab used in “freestyle recurve ar -\nchery” , the face of a tab for barebow archery has no cut-\nout between the forefinger and second finger.\nThe barebow tabs are available in small, medium and \nlarge sizes for either right or left hand shooters. The face \nshould be just long enough to cover the drawing fingers"}

Any surplus \nmay be cut off.\nA tab with an anchor shelf is only suitable if the facial ref-\nerence is located under the jawbone. It is preferable for a \nbarebow archer to use a tab without an anchor shelf, to \nobtain a firm and repeatable facial reference. Some tabs \nare adjustable and allow the location of the facial refer -\nence to be varied. These tabs permit the archer to have a \nlower anchor point, if required maybe under the cheek -\nbone.\nStitches of approximately 3 mm assist in finger place-\nment on the string when string walking is used. An adjust-\nment of the finger placing on the string of 3 mm equates \nto making a sight adjustment for approximately 5 metres \ndepending on the draw weight of the bow, the archer’s \ndraw length, the weight of the arrow and the archer’s \ntechnique. Practice will confirm these parameters to the \nindividual archer. Positioning of the fingers on the string \nfor string walking can be accurately determined by using \na tab; a shooting glove gives less accurate measurement.\n3. Shooting T echnique And Tuning\n3.1 Starting barebow shooting:\nIn the FITA Coaches Manual, Entry Level the beginning \narcher has been taught the basic elements of shooting, we \nnow go on with the aspects that concerns shooting with \nthe barebow. In barebow, the recommended technique to \ninstruct beginners is ‘point of aim’ (aiming over the arrow \npoint), which basically the barebow style.\nBeginning archers have to learn and stabilize the \nshooting routine and find out the fundamentals of bare-\nbow shooting. It is recommended for beginning archers \nto start at a short distance, say 15 metres (depending on \nage and draw weight sometimes 5 to 8 metres will suffice). \nThis will allow the archer to shoot with both eyes open or \none eye closed and to have one constant string position \nand anchor point, so that they can concentrate on getting \nthe smallest possible arrow groups.\nDraw and anchoring are vital parts of the routine and \nmust be consistent before going to other distances. It’s a \ngood idea for beginners in order to find the correct an-\nchor point to use a kisser button which has to be adjusted \nby the coach, thus the archer can correct himself quite \neasily.\nThe point of aim can vary with the distance to be \nshot. The beginning barebow archer should not worry \nabout any aiming procedure until they feel comfortable \nhandling and performing the basic fundamentals of the \nbarebow like stance, drawing, anchor point, release and \nfollow-through. When a general understanding of fun-\ndamentals of the barebow is acquired, the archer should \nconcentrate on aiming and getting small groups of arrows \nat one constant close distance (5-8 metres or 15 meters) \non a large Gold (cut from a 122 cm target face) and there-\nafter at various distances.\nWhen the archer’s head is in the correct position, the \narcher tends to ‘look through’ the bow string. The setting \nand checking of the bowstring alignment becomes au-\ntomatic with experience and most of the concentration \nfor aiming purposes must be directed to the arrow point. \nBefore the archer starts focusing on the gold, and whilst \ndrawing the string towards their anchor point, the archer \nshould align the bow string and bring the point of the ar -\nrow in their focus line on the gold.\nMost archers prefer on the longer distances, to set the \narrow point just underneath the centre with the top edge \nof the arrow point just touching the lower border of the \ngold, so that the arrow point will not cover the whole gold. \nOn the short distances they prefer to set the arrow point \non the gold. ‘On the job’ training is the best teacher.\nNew archers shooting barebow have the tendency to \nrelease the arrow as soon as they are in the gold without \nproperly aiming (‘snap shooters’). Let them hold for one \nto two seconds as soon as they are ‘in the gold’ for proper \naiming.\nAfter the archer has acquired experience in aiming \nwith the barebow the archer can practice with the correct \ntarget faces at the correct distances. It is also recommend-\ned, as barebow is mostly shot in the Field or 3D discipline, \nto practice with 3D animals on their specific distances.\nThere is a subjective, kinaesthetic feeling, the expe-\nrienced barebow archer attains when the arrow point is \nplaced on the gold during the aiming process prior to \nrelease. Progress is made only through intense attention, \nand nothing must be allowed to interfere with the inten-\nsity when the arrow point is placed in the gold."}
{"id": "Coaching_Manual_Level2-0033", "source": "Coaching_Manual_Level2.pdf", "chunk_index": 32, "page_start": 43, "page_end": 43, "text": "Barebow 7\nAs soon as a good basic form has been mastered the \nconcentration switches over to the aiming process and \nthe degree of scoring success one has whilst shooting \nbarebow. One must be aware of what effect on the accura-\ncy of the arrows the weather conditions have at different \nvelocities and directions. (Of course, different weather \nconditions have their specific effect on the arrow flight). \nAiming adjustments have to be made and the experience \nin different weather conditions becomes the best teacher.\nThrough extensive practice over a long period of time, \nthe archer increases skills related to barebow shooting \nand kinaesthetic awareness, to correct responses to differ-\nent conditions, e.g. changing wind speed and directions. \nThese factors and others, enable the skilled archer to ad-\njust rapidly as they look over the arrow point towards the \nintended target.\n3.2 Stance and body alignment:\nIt is desirable that the archer’s stance is consistent, but as \nbarebow is mostly shot in Field or 3D competitions, the \nterrain, which can change from post to post, dictates the \nstance. This regards especially the lower body; the upper \nbody can keep consistency in shooting under most ter -\nrain circumstances.\nThe base for a good body alignment is a well-balanced \nstance. Novices should at first build up a consistent shoot-\ning form on an even shooting range. They should think \nof a tall straight tree reaching for the sky, with the roots \ndeep in the ground. In non-extreme field conditions the \nfrontal plane of the body is in the shooting plane, shoul-\nders, hips and feet in line, chin and nose pointing towards \nthe target. Maintain your preset posture while raising and \ndrawing the bow.\nBarebow archers have to practice all kinds of stances \nand learn how to balance on uneven terrain, where the \nweight of their body often rests mainly on one leg only. \n(With uphill and downhill shots the lower leg is carry -\ning the main load). Very steep downhill shots sometimes \nforce the archer to kneel on their rear knee. The same \napplies, the other way round, to very steep uphill shots, \nwhere the archer may kneel on the knee pointing towards \nthe target (front leg).\nWhereas the recommendation in target archery is that \nthe body weight is evenly distributed over both feet, the \nrecommendation for barebow archery is that the distri-\nbution of body weight is approximately 60% on the front \nleg (the one closest to target) and 40% on the rear leg. In \nthe end the archer should feel comfortable and balanced \naccording to the different situations.\n3.3 Drawing\nDrawing is pulling the string to the anchor point in one \nsmooth movement. The most important aspect in bare-\nbow shooting is the consistency of the draw length. This \nis difficult, because there is no draw length indicator such \nas a clicker on the recurve bow or the valley/wall on the \ncompound bow.\nT o control the consistency of the draw length of the \narcher for practice purposes, may attach a white tape on \nthe inside of the bow window with a marking on the tape. \nWhile the archer is at full draw mark the arrow in line with \nthe marking on the tape, or make a mark on the arrow in \nline with the front/back end of the sight window.\nT o come to the correct draw length for barebow \nshooting it is advisable to start the draw a little higher \nthan shoulder height. The bow shoulder will be pushed \ntowards the butt as far as possible, thus is not contracted \nor allowed to collapse towards the spine, whereas the \nshoulder blade of the string side should move toward the \nspine as the bow is drawn.\n3.4 Aiming methods\nThere are three methods of aiming in barebow shooting. \nA combination of these methods can be adapted to suit \nthe individual archer.\nGap shooting\nFace walking\nString walking\nCombinations:\nFace and string walking\nString walking with gap shooting\nAll the above mentioned methods use the tip (point) \nof the arrow for height sighting and the string/bow win-\ndow edge for windage sighting. Below are two pictures \nshowing the most common sighting pictures. Develop -\nment of a method of sighting for a barebow archer is a \nlong process."}
{"id": "Coaching_Manual_Level2-0034", "source": "Coaching_Manual_Level2.pdf", "chunk_index": 33, "page_start": 44, "page_end": 44, "text": "FITA Coaching Manual Intermediate Level8\n3.5 Anchor point or ‘facial mark’\nThe anchor point depends on how the archer wants to \naim. Preference for a particular anchor point usually is \ndictated by the facial contours and the type of shooting. It \nis recommended that novices in barebow start with string \nwalking (which is the most accepted style) and a fixed \npoint of anchor on the face, preferably the cheek bone, \njust underneath the eye. Anchor points/facial marks are \nusually described as being high or low on the face. An an-\nchor point/facial mark on or under the mandible or jaw \nbone is termed low. An anchor point/facial mark on or \nunderneath the cheekbone is called high. Both types of \nanchor points/facial marks can be used effectively for any \nkind of barebow shooting.\n3.6 Gap Shooting\nGap shooting involves maintaining the same finger set -\nting on the string and the same facial reference at differ -\nent distances while sighting with the tip of the arrow on \ndifferent points above or below the target centre. The cor-\nrect gap (point of aim outside the target centre) has to \nbe determined for various distances and under varying \nshooting conditions, which is time consuming and can \nbe a frustrating exercise. The point of aim is usually below \nthe target centre at shorter distances and above the target \ncentre at the longer distances.\n3.7 Face Walking\nThe anchor point (facial mark) changes (‘walks’) on \nthe archer’s face depending on the distance of the tar -\nget. The photographs below show the variation in con-\ntact between the hand and face at various distances. \nThe facial reference is closer to the eye for the shorter \ndistances. Photos of LINHART Reingild (AUT), the \n2002 World Champion Women Barebow in Canberra \n(Australia).\nThe advantage of this method is that the tune of the bow \ndoes not alter with distance because the draw fingers are \nin the same position on the string for all distances. The \ndisadvantage is that left and right variations occur due to \nthe hand position following the anatomical shape of the \nface, that is, when the hand is located on the cheekbone it \nis further out with respect to the eye than when located at \nthe corner of the mouth.\nDifferent facial references are not as reliable as a \nfixed anchor point and finding the exact reference point \nfor each distance can be difficult to achieve making this \nmethod of aiming unreliable. Face walking is mostly used \nwith the long bow.\n3.8 String Walking\nThis method of shooting barebow is most common in \nfield archery. String walking means that the archer’s fin-\ngers change their position on the string when changing \nthe distance, while the anchor point (reference point) is \nconstant. The closer to the target, the lower the archer’s \nfingers are located on the string, (the arrow nock is closer \nto the eye). The further away from the target, the closer \nthe fingers are to the nocking point on the string, (the ar-\nrow nock is lower with respect to the eye).\nThe archer’s aim is over the point of the arrow. The \npoint of the arrow is sighted on the centre of the target, \nwhenever possible, while the position of the arrow nock \nis varied by altering the finger position up or down the \nstring for the varying target distances, in other words \nwalking the string means that the arrow point is constant \non the target centre while the finger position on the string \ndetermines the elevation for the distance to be shot.\nIf thicker thread (0.5 mm) for the centre serving is ap-\nplied, then string walking can be done by counting the \nthreads, otherwise we use the tab. Start with the top edge \nof the tab touching the nock, then move the thumbnail"}

Then place the draw fingers on the string in \nthe usual way. Some barebow archers have a longer and \nstraighter thumbnail for string walking.\nWith string walking the archer can shoot different dis-\ntances with reliable aiming and with a lot of checkpoints. \nThe standard grip on the string for string walking is with \nthree fingers under the nock. The facial reference point is \nthe tip of the forefinger touching the corner of the mouth \nwhile having the index finger located firmly underneath \nthe cheekbone.\nThe following pictures demonstrate what is described \nabove for a shot at a short distance of approximately 10 \nmetres.\nNotice the distance between the nock and the eye.\nThe following series of pictures shows the finger place-\nment at the middle distance of 30 metres. Marking the \ndistance with the thumb and setting the fingers at the \nright location, with the use of the tab and thumb.\nNotice the distance between the nock and the eye.\nThe following pictures show the fingers placement for \nthe longer distance of 50 metres. Marking the distance \nand setting the finger at the right location, with the use of \nthe tab and thumb.\nNotice the distance between the nock and the eye.\n3.9 Combination of Face and String Walking\nIn this method of aiming the archer uses two or three an-\nchor points and combines these with different locations \nof the fingers on the string. This method is useful for \nLong Bow archers. These bows expel the arrow at a much \nlower speed so that the archer needs more anchor points \nto achieve the correct elevation.\n3.10 String walking with Gap Shooting\nThis method of aiming becomes more and more popular \nand is simpler than string walking. The archer has a ta-\nble that maps each size of target face (20cm, 40cm, 60cm \nand 80cm) to a location on the string.

For example: \nAt a 40 cm target face the archer places the draw fingers \non the string as if the distance is 15 metres, shoot the first \narrow on the shortest distance, say 10 metres. Aim into \nthe middle of the target face, the arrows will hit the target \nface at the top in the 1 or 2 ring. The second arrow the \narcher shoots with the finger on the same location on the \nstring (15 metre mark) on the longest distance of the 40 \ncm target face and the arrow will hit in the lower part of \nthe target face (20 m). Now find out how much the archer \nhas to adjust to come in the centre. If the archer got a high \n(1 or 2) he would then have to aim into the 1 or 2 ring low \nin order to hit the centre of the target face.\nWith this system the archers have a constant anchor \npoint. They only use four markings on their string. This \nmethod is a lot easier than string walking, as the archer \ndoes not have to measure the distances. The archers has \nless points to keep in mind and therefore they can con-\ncentrate more on their technical part of shooting, such as \nkeeping up a consistent draw length, aiming and release, \nwhich are highly important when shooting barebow.\n3.11 Release\nThe release of the arrow is calculated to coincide with the \nvisual perception of the gap being closed by the arrow \npoint coming into view of the target whereas the bow will \nbe held motionless for a second when the gap has been \nclosed in order to implement an efficient release. It coin-\ncides also with the kinaesthetic perception of a good and \nstable form.\nReleasing the arrow is one of the most important fun-\ndamentals of shooting. The key elements are relaxation \nand concentration. Both of these elements must be under \ncomplete control. Releasing the arrow is not the result of \nforceful finger extension; it is an act of relaxing tensed fin-\ngers and muscular interaction with the bow hand. (Push \nand Pull interaction).\nThe bowstring literally pushes the fingers out of its \nway if the fingers have been relaxed sufficiently. It is very \nimportant that the archer understands that the draw arm \nmoves through its range of motion without interruption \n(Dynamic release). Some barebow archers have the ten-\ndency to have a static release, holding their string hand \nagainst their face and forcing the fingers to extend causing \nthe arrow to hit anywhere on the target and in due time it \ncan also cause muscular injuries.\nTraining the release (technique suggestions):\nSimulation of string hand relaxation. With the string fin-• \ngers, the archer grasps middle bow finger that is pointed \ndown. Have a flat string wrist and hand (the wrist joint \nshould be straight); the archer’s string hand should be \n‘twistable’ . Both elbows should be slightly higher than \nshoulder level. Let the archer simulate a release while \nwatching their string hand. At the end of the simula-\ntion, be sure that the archers hand is relaxed, the wrist \nshould be bent down and the fingers quite relaxed.\nT o get a good ‘mental picture’ of string fingers relaxa-• \ntion try following.\nT ake a bucket with a thin iron handle and fill it with • \nsand.

This ‘mental picture’ is \nthe same as releasing the string. The archer should try \nto remember this while practicing a perfect release.\n3.12 Follow through\nFollow through is essential for consistent performance \nand minute accuracy. The arrow hits the target before \nthe archer relaxes. The follow-through should be always \nthe same, no matter if the archer shoots at a long or short \ndistance, thus getting the sound of the arrow impact after \ndifferent time spans.\n3.13 Analyzing\nAfter every shot the archer should analyze their routine \nand the outcome (score).

When first acquired, the equipment is not suitable \nfor shooting until basic tuning is carried out. Tuning is re-\nquired by all types of bows to ensure that the equipment \nfits the archer and is capable of achieving good groups.\nBarebow archers who use only gap shooting and/or \nface walking (with only one draw point on the string), \ntune their bow just the same as recurve archers; they have \nonly one draw point on the string. The (fixed) draw point \non the string is one of the parameters for tuning. In string \nwalking we use different draw points on the string, for \ntuning we use a middling draw point.\nMost bows are reasonably tolerant to small deviations \nof the normal static tiller. The static tiller is the distance \nfrom the upper limb base (or limb pocket) to the string \nminus the distance from the lower limb base (or limb \npocket) to the string. Check the manufacturers recom-\nmended measurements for setting the static tiller on the \nparticular bow being used. Keep the static tiller as small \nas possible on your barebow for good results. Tiller ad-\njustment is carried out as for recurve bows.\nThe force generated at the nock of the arrow during \nthe release and arrow acceleration varies with different \nfinger positions on the string. The nocking point height \nfor string walking is a compromise that will give accept -\nable arrow flight at both short and long distances. The \nnocking point is usually set for correct arrow flight at a \nmid-way distance. Start with the top of the bottom nock-\ning point 5 to 6 mm above square. Shoot some arrows and \ngo through the tuning method found in the Recurve Bow \nsection of this manual.\n4. Conclusion\nCoaching of all forms of barebow archery should concen-\ntrate on correct style with emphasis on the facial refer -\nence and string alignment. The basic upright posture as \nintroduced in the FITA Entry Level Coaching Manual \nshould be encouraged. Variations to this form is inevita-\nble if used for Field Archery due to the uneven feet posi-\ntion in the field but a good sound basic form should be \ndeveloped. The facial reference is the rear sight and as \nsuch must be consistent. Depending on the archer’s style \ntheir facial reference will be dictated by the aiming meth-\nod used.

The people allocated \nto the individual scoring zones walk round following \nthe tape collecting the arrows that have fallen within \ntheir zone.

Then each \nperson walks forward in turn to retrieve their arrows, in \ndescending score order and calling out the score as each \narrow is retrieved.\nSome rules\nThe competition organiser may choose whether the com-\npetition will be shot in ends of three arrows or ends of six \narrows. If an end of three arrows is selected then the archers \nwill have a maximum of 2 minutes to shoot their three ar-\nrows. If an end of six arrows is selected then the archers will \nhave a maximum of 4 minutes to shoot their six arrows.\nThe archers may not raise their bow arm until the sig-\nnal to commence shooting is given.\nIf an archer shoots an arrow before or after the allotted \ntime they will forfeit the highest scoring arrow.\nAiming\nT o obtain even a modest score it is essential to be sighted \nin correctly from the first scoring end.\nIf the system doesn’t allow this (apart from luck) one \ncan easily spend two or three ends just getting a group in \nthe right place. As the round is very short all chance of \ncompeting or even obtaining a reasonable score can be \nover before begun.\nBecause of the elevation of the bow most people can-\nnot see the clout flags to aim at so that they need to pick a \nspot somewhere in the back or foreground to aim at. While \nthis can be fine once the spot has been determined there is \noften difficulty, at unfamiliar venues, to find out just where \nthat is. In addition, with a long line, the background can \nvary significantly from end to end, thus presenting an un-\nfair advantage to those with easily distinguishable spots \nto aim at, for instance an apartment building with lots of \nwindows as apposed to say a blank concrete wall.\nIf a standard modern recurve bow as explained in a) & \nb) above is used.

Which \never method is used it must be adhered to minutely as all \nerrors, no matter how small, are magnified by distance.\nShooting T ecniques\nMost coaching points apply equally to clout as in target \nshooting, consisting of posture, minimal head movement, \nbow-hand movement and follow-through being control-\nled, a reaction not an action is vital and is of paramount \nimportance. Good groups at the maximum range of the \nbow indicate superior technique which is highly desir -\nable.\nA clean physical follow-through where the string hand \ngoes straight back in a natural reaction is to be desired, \nrather than a bicep/triceps, dead loose type of release. \nUsing a kisser button al-\nlowing the drawing hand \nto be lower than a normal \nanchor position.\nThe better the release the more consistent the arrow flight \nwill be, and consequently better arrow grouping will be \nachieved.\nAnother important point is the bow verticality. For \ntraining your archer in keeping their bow vertical, you can \naffix a level somewhere on the bow. Y our recurve archers \nwill have to remove this device for the competitions.\nStrategies\nIn general it is a big help to ascertain the line the shot and \nto watch the flight of the arrow. This is done by looking \naway from the aiming point, immediately after releasing, \nup to the arrow and observing the flight then correcting \nthe aim for the next shot. This will also help to see if the \narrows match the bow or undue “kicks” or poor arrow \nflight is apparent.\nThe problem with this method is that the archer en-\nsure a poor follow-through, this is why the coach should \ntake care of the arrow flight, while the archer remains fo -\ncussed on the aiming point.\nT o check the length or distance of the shot when \nshooting two ends of 3 arrows, between ends walk as far \nto the side as practical and with binoculars seek the dis -\ntances of your archer’s shafts.\nWhen coaching a Compound archer it is advisable \nto have them shoot very low to start with as many com-\npound bows are capable of shooting vast distances and \nmay even overshoot the safety area. There is also another \nproblem that compound shooters may encounter, with \nthe extreme power the arrows will have a flat trajectory \nand may be difficult to find if the grass is not kept quite \nshort. If the ground is also very hard and the trajectory \nis very low the arrows may not stick into the ground but \nmay “snake into the grass” and be difficult to locate.\nMaximum distance is usually obtained by shooting at \napproximately 43 degrees, although there is liable to be a \ndifference if a strong head or tail wind is blowing.\nIllustration of various angles and trajectories."}

The Compound Bow\nAxle to axle length\nThe overall length of a compound bow is measured from \naxle to axle (the axle is the shaft through the limbs that \nthe cams are mounted on).\nCurrently compounds range in length from 30˝ to 48˝ \naxle to axle. Shorter bows are commonly considered dif -\nficult to shoot and not as well suited to target archery as \nlonger bows. Bows with very long lengths, above 45˝, are \ngenerally forgiving to shoot but tend to be much slower \nthan shorter bows. Most compound target archers shoot \na bow with a length between 38˝ and 43˝ for shooting \nwith a mechanical release.\nUpper cam\nUpper limb\nLimb pocket\nWeight adjustm ent bolt\nSight\nScope\nLauncher/Arrow\nrest\nStabili ser\nLimb pocket\nWeight adjustm ent blot \nBottom limb\nBottom cam \nString\nPeep sight\nCable slider\nCable guard\nGrip\nRi ser\nCables\nRiser design\nThere are three common riser designs: reflex, deflexed \nand straight.

The deflexed riser curves \nforward with the grip ahead of the limb pockets, the grip \nis further from the string than the limb pockets are. As \nthe name implies the straight riser is straight with the grip \nand the pockets in line, parallel with the string.\nThe reflex riser is the most widely available.

This is true of not only the shape, but also \nthe features and benefits of the shape. Very few bows are \nmarketed with a perfectly straight riser.\nAs indicated above the riser design plays a part in the \nbrace height of the bow. Brace height is the distance be-\ntween the throat of the grip and the string when the bow is \nin the braced position (not drawn). A lower brace height \nextends the power stroke of the bow by pushing further \nforward on the arrow than a higher brace height. By push-\ning on the arrow for a longer period, more energy, speed, \nis imparted on the arrow. This increase in speed may be an \nadvantage, however the increased amount of time that the \narrow spends on the string, means that there is more time \nfor the archer to make an error, or more time for errors to \naffect the arrow. Bows used for target archery generally \nhave a minimum of seven inches of brace height. Most \ntarget bows’ brace height falls between seven and one half \ninches and nine inches.\nDraw force curve\nA draw force curve is a curve on a graph that represents \nthe stored energy of a bow. Along the “Y” axis is draw \nweight, and along the “X” axis is draw length or power \nstroke of a bow. Power stroke is the distance that the bow-\nstring pushes on the arrow. Power stroke is equal to:\nThe draw length minus• \nThe brace height of a bow and something more (be-• \ncause the arrow leaves the string after the string has \npassed brace height).\nThe curve in graph 1 represents the energy stored when a \nRecurve bow is drawn.

Notice that this cam \ndesign has the most shaded area indicating the increased \nenergy stored by a hard cam compound bow as compared \nto the two previous examples.\nGraph 3\nIncreasing the peak weight of a bow or lengthening the \ndraw length/power stroke of a bow increases the amount \nof shaded area below the curve. This increased shading \nrepresents the increase in energy or ultimately arrow ve-\nlocity that results from these changes.\nEccentrics\nThere are many eccentric systems on the market. Each \nstyle of eccentric offers a different set of features and \nbenefits. The axis of the “Eccentrics” is not suspended \ncentrally but eccentrically to achieve a mechanical ad-\nvantage. T raditionally Eccentrics have been classified as \ncams or round wheels. Cams are elliptical in shape, which \nresult in a large amount of stored energy and high arrow \nvelocities. As the name implies, round wheels are round \nin shape, this results in less stored energy, lower veloci-\nties and a smoother pull. There are also several eccentric \nstyles within the cam category. These consist of one cam, \nHybrid (cam and one half ) and two cam systems. When \nproperly tuned, as outlined in section 9 of this chapter, \nthese cam systems all shoot well.\nWhen choosing a bow, keep this in mind. All string \nand cable assemblies stretch some amount, some more \nthan others.

The draw \nlength, poundage, cam position, brace height, axle to axle \nlength, let-off and nocking point position all change with \nthis stretch. T o make the bow shoot as it did when first \ntuned, small adjustments to the string and cable lengths \nwill be required. On most bows, a few twists to the string \nand cables will return them to their original length. Con-\nsult the bow owner’s manual for the optimal “timing” or \n“cam position” for the eccentric system on your bow.\nLet-off refers to the amount of reduction in draw weight \nthat occurs when the eccentrics of a compound bow roll \nover. This is expressed as a percentage. For example a \nbow with 75% let-off and 60 pound draw weight will be 15 \npounds holding weight after the cams roll over at full draw. \nBow manufacturers offer cams with let–off percentages \nthat typically range from 60%to 80%. For shooting with \ngood form and back tension, the increased holding weight \nfound on bows with lower let-off may be desirable.\nThere are several ways to slightly reduce the let-off \non some bows that do not have adjustable let-off. One \nof these ways is to shorten the string to shorten the draw \nlength and roll the cam position back. The draw length \nmay then be adjusted to its original draw length by replac-\ning or adjusting the draw length module. Another way to \nreduce let-off is to increase the diameter of the buss cable \nwhere it crosses the axle at full draw.\nStrings and Cables\nSelect the number of strands that results in the proper diam-\neter string for the cam groove diameter. The string should \nfill the cam groove, but not be wedged into the groove.\nSelect the diameter of serving material for the center serv-\ning providing the proper diameter to fit the nocks on the \narrows. The nock of the arrow should snap on the string \nwithout any side to side movement, dragging slightly as it \nslides up and down the string.\n String too thick. String too thin."}

Initial Set-Up (before tuning)\nTiller\nTiller is the relationship between the base of the bow \nlimbs and the string when the bow is at brace. T o measure \ntiller, use a bow square or ruler held perpendicular to the \nstring to measure the distance between the limb where it \nenters the limb pocket and the string. The distance meas-\nured for the top (a) limb can be compared with the dis -\ntance measured for the bottom limb (b) to determine the \ntiller setting of the bow.\nThere are many opinions on how the tiller of a com-\npound bow should be adjusted and the effects of such \nadjustments. If most of the archers strive to get the same \ndistance “base of top limb / string” as the distance “base \nof the bottom limb / string” some believe that whatever \nthe initial setup of the tiller, as long as the bow is tuned, \nit doesn’t make any difference how the tiller is set on a \ncompound bow.\nT o adjust the tiller of a compound bow one or both \nweight adjustment bolts, limb bolts, are turned with one \nchanging position more than the other. Tightening a bolt \nwill decrease the measurement for the end of the bow that \nthe bolt is on. Loosening the bolt increases the measure-\nment. Adjusting the tiller of a compound bow will affect \nthe following items; draw weight, the angle of the riser \nbetween the limbs in relation to the string (grip angle), \nthe relationship between the nocking point and arrow \nrest and brace height. Adjusting the tiller of a compound \nbow will not effect synchronization of the cams or the \nstrength of the limbs.\n(a)\n(b)\nThere are two methods commonly used to adjust tiller. \nOne method is to measure the tiller and adjust the bolts \nuntil both ends are even. The other is to tighten the bolts \nuntil the limbs are as tight as they go, then turn the bolts \nback in even amounts until the desired draw weight is \nachieved. The second way depends on the precision with \nwhich thread of the bolt and the riser had been manufac-\ntured. An archer may wish to consult the bow owner’s \nmanual for recommended settings.\nMany of the newer cam systems have different shaped \neccentrics on the top and bottom limbs. As a result the \ntiller may be uneven when the limbs are adjusted to the \nsame point. These different shaped eccentrics may also \ncause the tiller measurements to change unevenly when \nstring or cable lengths are adjusted. If an archer wishes \nto measure tiller and the eccentrics are different in shape, \na piece of thread may be tied between the axles that go \nthrough the limb tips, and a measurement between this \nthread and the limb may be used.\nT o check or adjust the tiller on a bow that has virtually \nparallel limbs; it may be necessary to measure between \nthe upper limb pocket pivot point and the bottom limb \ncam axle (a), then compare this to the measurement be-\ntween the bottom limb pocket pivot point and the upper \nlimb cam axle (b). T o make an adjustment the limb bolts \ncan be adjusted as previously mentioned.\nIt is advisable to check with the manufacturer for the cor-\nrect procedure and expected results.\nDraw weight\nFITA rules limit the draw weight to 60 lbs.

When adjusting the draw weight for an archer, make \nsure the bow is drawn using the muscles of the back. As an \narcher’s strength increases, the weight may be increased. \nRegardless of what the draw weight is, the archer should \nbe able to shoot a full FITA in one day without excessive \nfatigue. The archer should have enough strength to ex -\necute the last shot with the same proper form as the first \nshot.\nHeavier draw weights make it easier to reach 70 and \n90 meters due to a flatter trajectory as well as performing \nbetter in the wind. T rajectory is the arc of the arrow.\nHigher trajectory when shooting a recurve bow.\nFlatter trajectory when shooting a compound bow.\nWith a lower arc, it is easier to sight in at longer distances \nwithout the sight having to be adjusted into the path of \nthe arrow.\nAnother advantage of a flatter trajectory is the reduc-\ntion of errors from the miss-estimation of distance. This \nis particularly beneficial for field archery and other un-\nmarked distance shooting.\nDraw length\nA proper length gives leverage and control over the bow \nas well as leverage to generate back tension. A proper draw \nalso allows for clearance for the string at the chest and \nbow arm. Set the draw length so the release hand can find \na stable spot, for instance: against the jawbone (popular), \ndepression behind the ear... See “Facial marks” from the \nFORM Chapter. Having the stable release hand helps to \nsteady the bow as well as properly positioning the draw \narm. The drawing elbow should be located directly be-\nhind or slightly outside the line of the arrow while at full \ndraw. If the elbow is rotated behind the head, the draw \nlength is too long. The drawing elbow should also be held \nup to or above the line of the arrow.\nWhen measuring a new archer for their draw length, \npay close attention to the position of head, anchor point, \nbow shoulder, bow arm and posture. Archers will natu-\nrally try to mold to or fit a compound bow, because it has \na pre set stopping point. Archers may lean their head or \ntorso to fit a bow that is too long, or they may hunch to fit \na bow that is too short. It is important to fit the bow to the \narcher not the archer to the bow. An exceptionally light \nweight Recurve bow, a light draw weight compound bow \nwith no let-off, or an elastic band attached to a bow to \nrepresent a light weight draw string may be used in con-\njunction with a draw length arrow to determine an arch-\ners proper draw length. A draw length arrow is one with \npreprinted marks indicating the length to which the bow \nis drawn.\nKeep in mind that regardless of the method used to ini-\ntially determine an archer’s draw length, adjustments may \nneed to be made as the archer progresses. A bow with an \nadjustable draw length may be desirable for beginning \narchers.\nWhen purchasing/selecting a bow it is important to un-\nderstand how manufacturers measure draw length of the \nbow.

Most manufacturers represent \nthe draw length of their bows in this manner.\n4. Accessories\nRest\nAn arrow rest should be very solid and consistent. It \nshould also be adjustable enough to make tuning easy. \nThe “Pacesetter” or “lizard tongue” style of arrow rest is \neasy to tune and forgiving to shoot.. 008˝ or. 010˝ blade \nthickness works well with light weight arrows. With these \nthinner sizes, it is easier for the arrow to “push through” \nthe blade if there is unwanted contact with the arrow. The \narrow may fall off of this type of rest during the draw if an \narcher is not in good physical condition. In this case use \na heavier launcher blade. If the arrow repeatedly falls off \nof the rest, the archer will become fatigued and discour -\naged.\nFall away arrow rests are gaining in popularity. These \narrow rests are designed to move away from the arrow at \nthe point of release, so the fletching does not contact the \nrest.\nDraw leng th to pivot \npoint (D.L.P.P.) \nStandardized \nAMO draw length \nD.L.P.P. + 1¾� (44,5 mm)\nMeasured draw \nlength = nocking \npoint to the far side \nof the bow. \nMeasured\ndraw length \nAs a starting point mount the rest so that there is ap -\nproximately one inch (25 mm) of the arrow in front of \nthe rest.\nWhen the rest begins to fall the arrow should have trav -\nelled approximately 3 inches (75 mm). If the distance is \ngreater than 3 inches (75 mm), the rest, due to the speed \nof the arrow, may not clear the fletchings. It is imperative \nthat fletching clearance is confirmed after this adjustment \nwhich can be checked by spreading the fletching area \nwith some (foot) powder. Spray the fletching area of the \narrow with foot powder, taking care not to disturb the \npowdered area, shoot the arrow into a firm Butt. Inspect \nthe powdered area of the arrow for marks which may in-\ndicate contact problems.\nMount the arrow rest on the bow so that the center \nof the arrow shaft is at or slightly below the center of the \nmounting bolt.

T o adjust center shot, \nplace an arrow on the bow and point the bow away from \nyou. Line a point on the string approximately one inch \nbelow the top cam up with the string that is in the groove \nwrapped around the cam. Without moving, glance down \nto the center of the string and the arrow. When the bow \nis in center shot, the string will appear to run right down \nthe center of the arrow.\nLimb alignment gauges can be used for this section, but \nas there are many types of bows and set-ups the following \nis a suggested method of the procedure:–Measure across \nthe end of the limbs with a rule, find the centre, then \nmeasure the distance from this centre point to the centre \nof the string track on the cam. Stick a piece of masking \ntape across the limb just at the end of the riser. Find the \ncentre of the limb at this point and put a small mark on \nthe masking tape. From this point add the same distance \nas the offset of the string and make a mark, then put a \nheavy pencil mark either side of this point approximately \nthe width of the string.\nThese two lines can then be used to visually line up \nthe string. If a release aid is to be used, the rest can then \nbe adjusted to move the arrow in or out from the riser to \nget the string alignment so that the string passes straight \nalong the arrow. If this bow is to be shot off the fingers \nthen the pyle of the arrow needs to be slightly out to the \nleft of the string (known as the archer’s paradox). This \nsetting is required to compensate for the interference the \nreleasing fingers have on the string, which in turn affects \nthe initial flight of the arrow.\nThe drawing shows a right-handed bow set-up.\nIf limb alignment gauges are used care must be taken \nthat the gauges are close to the top and bottom of the riser \nand that they are properly attached to the limbs.\nIt is not imperative that this adjustment be absolutely \nperfect, as the rest will likely be re-adjusted during the \ntuning process.\nNocking point/loop\nThe height of the nocking point on the string should be \nset so the arrow appears to be level when the bow is held \nstraight up and down. That is the arrow is perpendicular \nto the string. Once again this setting is not critical, as it \ntoo will be moved in the tuning process.\nHand tied nock sets and a rope release work very well. \nA string loop is also popular. There are three effective \nways to tie a string loop. The first is to tie the top and bot-\ntom knots equally spaced above and below the arrow.\nWith this loop the release will be pulling from a point \nslightly above the nock of the arrow. This results in very \nlittle pressure from the arrow on the arrow rest. With very \nlittle downward pressure, it is somewhat easier for the ar-\nrow to fall off of the rest.\nThe second loop is the same as the first with the addi-\ntion of a nocking point placed below the arrow inside of \nthe loop.\n 6"}

This loop may be shorter in \nlength, because there is no need to leave room for the ar-\nrow nock between the release and the string.\nSight\nA sight should be easily and accurately adjusted with a re-\nliable locking system. Having a level on the sight is impor-\ntant for shooting distances beyond 18m. Canting the bow \naffects the impact of the arrow greatly at longer distances. \nLevel the sight bar and scope with the bow so windage \ndoes not change when the elevation is adjusted.\nA scope on a compound bow consists of a housing \nwith a single lens and a level.\nThe power, magnification, of the scope lens is based on \npersonal preference. Four and six power lenses are most \ncommon. The higher the magnification the lens has the \nmore detail you will see of the target. The higher power \nnot only magnifies the target, but it also magnifies the ap-\npearance of the archers wiggle. Seeing too much wiggle \nmay be detrimental. Choose scope housing color, diame-\nter and peep sight size so that it is easy to center the scope \naccurately in the peep. A black scope, peep and aiming \ndot is easy to center and focus on. Black is a soft color and \neasy for the eye to focus on. Choose a peep diameter that \nallows you to see a narrow ring of light around the outside \nof the scope housing. This will help to keep the peep cen-\ntered on the scope. When aiming with a peep sight and a \nlevel, the archer should center the peep on the scope and \ncheck the level before focusing on the dot in the scope \nor the target. Once the focus shifts to the dot or target, it \nshould remain there. The peep and the level should not \ndistract the archers aiming.\nT o install a sight on a compound bow, bolt the sight \non the riser and set the sight extension at the length it will \nbe shot at. Pulling the extension in close to the riser will \ncause the archer to see less detail while aiming as well as \nless perceived wiggle. Extending the sight shows more \ndetail for finer aiming as well as magnifying the appear -\nance of wiggle. Place the bow so the string is vertical in all \ndirections or plum.\nNext place a level against the vertical adjustment bar.\nLoosen the screws that hold the bar onto the exten-\nsion and adjust the bar so that it is level. Re-tighten the \nscrews on the bar. With the level against the vertical bar, \nloosen the scope on the sight block and adjust it until the \nlevel in the scope matches the level on the vertical bar.\nRe-tighten the scope on the sight block."}

Consult the \nowner’s manual for the sight to find the proper screws or \nadjustments for the third axis.\nSights designed for Recurve bows may not withstand \nthe vibration of a compound bow.\nPeep Sight\nA peep sight is the rear sight on a compound bow.

This wiggle will often appear \nto take the shape of horizontal figure eight on the face \nof the target. If the bow is too light the sight will wiggle \nvery quickly around the face of the target.

Fletching on indoor arrows \nranges from two inch vanes to five inch feathers. Personal \npreference plays a large part in selecting fletching for in-\ndoor arrows.\nOutdoor\nSmaller diameter aluminum/carbon or carbon arrows \nare better suited to shooting outdoors. The smaller diam-\neter and lighter weight of these arrows makes it easier to \nreach 70 and 90 meters, as well as performing better in \nthe wind. Heavy point weight is considered beneficial for \nshooting long distances. 90 to 125 grain points are com-\nmon depending on arrow size and weight. One and a half \nto two inch vanes are most common on outdoor arrows. \n“Spin Wing” type vanes may be more likely to contact \nthe arrow rest of a compound bow, and are not typically \nused for this purpose. If an archer wishes to try this type \nof vane, a fall away style rest may be in order.\nIn order to produce the most consistent arrows pos -\nsible, all arrows should be fletched on the same fletching \njig. Arrows should be numbered so each arrows perform-\nance can be evaluated, and problem arrows can easily be \nidentified.\nLength\nT o determine the proper arrow length use an arrow with \na scale on the side of it or use a full length arrow that may \nbe marked. Place the arrow in the bow and draw it back \nto full draw. It is important to do this with the release that \nthe bow is to be shot with, because a different measure-\nment will result if the bow is drawn with fingers. Once the \narcher is at full draw, another person may mark the shaft \nor read the length at a point that is one inch in front of \nthe contact point of the arrow rest. The length the arrows \nare cut to changes the way they react in regard to stiffness. \nIf the stiffness needs to be changed, this length may be \naltered somewhat.\nSpine\nWhen selecting arrows for indoor or outdoor shooting, it \nis important to select a shaft with the proper spine, stiff -\nness, for the bow they are to be shot out of. T o select the \nproper spine make note of the draw weight, cam type and \nproper arrow length.

For practical \npurposes we can group them into three categories: Pure \nback tension releases, hand held releases with a trigger \nand wrist strap releases.\nPure back tension releases are a hand held release that \ndoes not rely on a trigger to fire.\nThese releases fire as a result of changes that occur in the \nhead of the release when the archer pulls with fingers on \nthe release.\nThumb release\nFinger release with \nwrist strap.\nActivates on increased \nholding pressure.\nThumb release with \nwrist strap\nSecond Finger and wrist pull \nwith finger release.\nBack tension release."}

The wrist strap release also has a \ntrigger which is manipulated which causes it to fire.\nMany archers believe that hand held releases are more \nsuitable for executing a surprise release by the use of the \nmuscles located in the archers back and posterior part of \nthe string shoulder, any of these three types of release aids \ncan generate such a “surprise release” . Nevertheless arch-\ners will find this achievement more or less easy pending \nthe release aid design. This is why a personal research has \nto be done by testing various release aids.\nMore about the release technique in “Shot Execution” \nof the FORM Chapter.\n7. Form\nLevel I Manual\nThe basic form used to shoot with a compound bow is \nessentially the same as described in the FITA Level 1 \nCoaching Manual for shooting a Recurve bow. There are \na few exceptions as listed below.\nBow arm/hand\nWith a low wrist grip, and the pressure at the bottom of \nthe palm, the bones in the wrist support the bow. Using \nbones to support the bow is more consistent than using \nmuscles, as the bones do not change. The pressure of the \nbow should be placed at the bottom of the palm between \nthe muscles, on the thumb-side of the lifeline. The pres -\nsure on the bow riser should be slightly below the center \nof the grip with the thumb and index fingers all the way at \nthe top of the grip. This pressure should be focused on the \nleft edge of the riser for right-handed archers. The knuck-\nles of the bow hand should be at a forty-five degree angle \nfrom the vertical line of the grip. This angle will result in \na space between the little finger side of the palm and the \nriser. The fingers of the bow hand should be totally re-\nlaxed on the front of the grip, but not open. The arm may \nbe bent downward slightly or straight but not locked. The \nshoulder should be as low as possible\nWhen shooting with the proper bow hand position as \ndescribed above, the bow may fall out of the hand upon \nrelease. A sling is a strap or cord used to prevent the bow \nfrom falling. The sling can be permanently mounted on \nthe bow, or may be attached to the fingers or wrist of the \nbow hand and simply wrapped around the bow while \nin use. The sling does not hold the bow in the hand, but \nrather catches the bow when it begins to fall. If the sling \nis adjusted tightly to hold the bow in place, the sling can \nimpart unwanted torque on the bow. The bow may typi-\ncally be allowed to fall into the sling a distance about as \nlong as the thumb.\nFacial Marks\nThis technical element was formerly named “anchor \npoint”; it is the position that the drawing hand is consist-\nently placed on the jaw or face of the archer while aiming \nand executing a shot. Depending on the style of release"}
{"id": "Coaching_Manual_Level2-0057", "source": "Coaching_Manual_Level2.pdf", "chunk_index": 56, "page_start": 68, "page_end": 68, "text": "FITA Coaching Manual Intermediate Level14\naid, it is common to place the thumb or knuckles of the \ndraw hand against the jaw as part of the anchor point. The \ntip of the nose is typically placed on the string as an ad-\nditional reference point. Archers wearing eye glasses may \nnot be able to position the tip of the nose on the string \nand still see properly. In this case the head may be held \nerect and slightly turned in order to see through the lens. \nThe anchor point is very important, however it is not \nas critical with a compound bow equipped with a peep \nsight as it is with a Recurve bow without a peep sight. The \npeep sight provides consistent aiming by requiring the \neye to be properly aligned behind the sight in order to see \nthrough it. This results in less reliance on the anchor. The \nanchor point becomes very consistent as a result of the \nrepetitious nature of practice.\n8. Shot Execution (Release)\nThere are various techniques for executing the shot. Be-\nlow we will make some comments about some combina-\ntions of the following 4 principles:\n2 will refer to the “intention” of the shot: “Command-• \ned release” and “Surprise release”\n2 will refer to the part of the body generating the shot: • \n“Finger T riggering” (activate the trigger with a fin-\nger) and “Continuous Draw Increase” (Back T ension, \nbody extension / spreading…).\nIt is useful to know the following methods when teach-\ning the proper use of a release.\nCommanded triggering\nThe name of this technique is self explanative: this is a \ncombination of:\nA triggering action–a finger (suddenly) activates the • \ntrigger (*).\nOn command (when the visual/aiming references • \nhave reached an enough good quality level).\nThis technique has a limited field of efficient action: when \nit is very windy.\nOtherwise, the mental order that the archer has to \nsend to his finger embeds a perfect follow-through and \nthe shot happens while the archer is no longer aiming. \nAlso a rapid finger motions often disturbs the overall \nsteadiness of the archer. This is why this technique is also \nknown as “Perfect aim and an imperfect shot.\nTwo classical bad evolutions of this technique are:\n“Punching” the trigger, a technical mistake known as • \n“finger hit” in shooting,\nT arget panic.• \n(*) This technique is also possible when using a release aid without a \ntrigger: the archer suddenly changes the angle of the release hand; as \nabove it is usually not a recommended technique.\nSmooth or progressive triggering.\nThis is a combination of a triggering action (a finger ac-\ntivates the trigger) but so continuously that the string is \nsurprisingly liberated by the trigger. (**)\nIn this method the bow is aimed at the target and the \ntrigger is continuously squeezed (usually slowly) while \nmaintaining the muscular tension in the archer’s back. A \nproper squeeze on the release should result in a surprise \nshot when the trigger gets off and the string is released. If \nimplemented this way, it is an excellent method!\nThere are two common problems with this method.\na) The archers does not provide a continuous squeeze \ntoward the end of the draw, but command the release \nwith some sort of punch as described above, due to:\nEither some impatience: the archers has a stable • \nsight for a while and the continuous squeeze has \nnot yet allow the triggers to go off;\nSome fair of the surprise release. The archer is • \nafraid that the trigger will go off when the sight \nwill be out of the target centre.\nb) The archer regulates the speed of squeezing according \nto his aiming quality:\nQuite fast squeeze when the peep, scope and tar -• \nget are well centered,\nSlow squeeze (or worst. stop squeezing) when un-• \nstable, misaligned or the wiggle is important.\nWhen this “regulation” applies we are very close to the \ntechnique of “Commanded triggering” as described above \nand the mental activity is split on the sighting and squeez-\ning activities. Nevertheless it would not be efficient to \ncontinue squeezing the trigger t the same pace, when the \nsight is really away from the target centre! Hence some \n“regulation” skill has to be developed in case of abnormal \nsight wiggling, as long as the archer does not “fall” in the \ncommanded triggering as described above.\n(**) This technique is also possible when using a release aid without a \ntrigger through 2 alternatives:\n– The archer progressively changes the angle of the release hand; \nthis alternative is usually not recommended."}

This technique is described below.\nNotes about the above T riggering methods (Command-\ned or Smooth/Progressive):\nA huge percentage of Compound archers (probably \nmore than 90%) are learning to shoot by “manipulat -\ning” the trigger. The reason they manipulate the trigger is \nbecause it is easier to learn and results in instant results, \nhowever short term they may be. Among the most fre-\nquent negative long term effects of the improper use of \nreleases, we can report:\n– Back and shoulders muscles relaxing before the shot is \nover.\n– T arget panic\nSurprise release generated by a Continuous Draw \nIncrease\nAccording to some experts, this is THE technique. It is a \nfact that over the last 15 – 20 years, this technique has be-\ncame quite popular among the elite Compound archers.\nThis method of shot execution is often called “back \ntension” . With this method the archer aims at the target \nand increases tension in the back and/or posterior part \nof the string shoulder, regardless of where the sight goes. \nOf course the archer always has the option to let the shot \ndown and start over if they do not like where the sight \ngoes. The outcome of this method is a surprise release \nresulting in perfect form. One of the main advantages of \nthis method is that it keeps the archer’s mind away from \nthe trigger and trigger hand, allowing an excellent follow-\nthrough (see further down)\nNotes about the surprise release (achieved through \nthe 2 latest techniques presented above):\n– In order for an archer who may be struggling with \nconcept to experience the feel of a surprise release, the \ncoach may squeeze the trigger of the release while the \narcher safely aims at a target.\n– The sight may not be perfectly centered when the bow \ngoes off. In opposition to the Commanded triggering \nmethod, this one can be summarized as “Imperfect \naim and a perfect shot” , through which the arrow is \nguaranteed to hit inside the wiggle area of the sight \nbecause it is executed with perfect form while the \nsubconscious mind makes the necessary corrections. \nWith practice, the wiggle area gets smaller and these \ngroups get tighter.\n– By strong wind, it might be more hazardous to solely \nuse “Surprise release” .\nExecuting the shot\nThe first order of business when teaching an archer to \nshoot with a mechanical release is to teach them how to \nsafely draw the bow without prematurely releasing. T o ac-\ncomplish this, the archer should draw with their thumb \nand fingers off of the trigger of the release aid. For pure \nback tension releases, the archer may want to brace the re-\nlease in a direction that will not allow it to fire by placing \nfingers against the back side of the release while drawing.\nIllustration: draw safely with a “pure Back tension” re-\nlease aid\nWhen learning how to shoot a compound bow with a \nmechanical release the archer should shoot at short range \nat a blank bale. The blank bale is also a good place to per-\nfect form and work on form improvements.\nOnce an arrow is nocked and the release is on the \nstring, raise the bow to rest on the knees or hip. Support \nthe bow by holding it up with the release so the bow hand \ncan be properly set on the riser. Next, raise the bow to the \nheight of the target and draw on target with the arrow as \nmuch parallel to the floor as possible. Pause between rais-\ning and drawing the bow to allow for a smooth draw and \nprevent the arrow from falling off of the rest.\nSafe Drawing Angle.\nSome archers tend to come down with elbow and \nhand while drawing back to make the draw easier (they \ninstinctively use additional muscles which help them to \novercome the peak weight); although the bow hand is \nkept in the same position the arrow point will then be \nhigher than the nock; if something breaks during that ac-"}
{"id": "Coaching_Manual_Level2-0059", "source": "Coaching_Manual_Level2.pdf", "chunk_index": 58, "page_start": 70, "page_end": 70, "text": "FITA Coaching Manual Intermediate Level16\ntion the arrow may fly way over the target and cause ac-\ncidents; this should be avoided under all circumstances.\nUnsafe Drawing Angle.\nThe sight should be at the center of the target when full \ndraw is reached. The sight will not remain on target dur -\ning the draw, due to the motion and effort necessary to \ndraw, but it should start and finish on target.\nWhen full draw is achieved, place the draw hand in \nthe proper anchor position and begin the aiming process. \nLook through the peep sight and center it on the scope \nhousing. Check the level.\nAt this point, focus on either the sight or the target, \nbut not both. Choose one and be consistent. The eye can-\nnot focus at two distances at the same time; this is why \none is chosen. Focusing on only one item also makes it \neasier to accept the wiggle area of the bow. Do not try to \nhold the bow still, let it float or wiggle. The subconscious \nmind will automatically keep the wiggle of the sight cen-\ntered on the target. “T rying” to hold still will cause more \nwiggles than simply trying to relax. Consciously trying \nto force the sight on the target causes unnecessary mus -\ncle movement in addition to the movement called for by \nthe subconscious. If the archer chooses to focus on the \ntarget, try using a very small dot or a ring on the scope \nlens that can easily be ignored by the conscious mind. If \nthe archer chooses to focus on the sight, try a large dot \non the lens that makes it easier for the conscious mind \nto ignore the target. T o explain this system, compare it to \nwatching television while a bug is flying around the room. \nIf a person is focused on the television program they will \nnot notice the movement of the bug. The bug would only \nbe noticed if it lands on the television screen. This is the \nsame as focusing on the target causes us to accept or not \nnotice the movement of the sight. In the case of focusing \non the sight instead of the target, if this person is focused \non the bug they cannot watch the television. It is the same \nprincipal either way.\nWhen using a pure back tension release (a trigger-less \nhinge type release), begin to pull at this point. If a release \nwith a trigger is being used, move the thumb or finger \nonto the trigger while centering the peep and checking \nthe level. Apply approximately one half of the pressure \nnecessary to release the trigger. Once the thumb or finger \nis properly set on the release, begin to pull with the back \nand/or posterior string shoulder muscles, as if pulling a \nbow through the clicker. When the proper muscles of the \nback are used for this pull, the bicep of the drawing arm is \nrelaxed. The tension in the release hand does not change \nat all, no increase and no relaxation.\nEntry to intermediate level archers holds the bow at \nfull draw with their back and arms and press the trigger \nwith their finger. Many of these archers “creep” as they \naim, indicating a decrease in back tension while at full \ndraw.\nOnce the pull with the back muscles begins, there is \nabsolutely no conscious thought about the release hand \nwhatsoever. After gaining an understanding of this, the \ndraw does not need to be stopped to check peep, level \nand set thumb. The draw will become a slow constant pull \nthroughout the shot. Again, this pull is the same as pull-\ning through the clicker on a bow.\nChanges in the body while pulling will cause the re-\nlease to fire all by itself. There is no need for thoughts \nabout when or how to shoot the shot ever again. Once the \npull is started the archer must be willing to pull forever; \naiming and pulling with no expectation that the shot will \never go off.\nAlthough it is important to trust the back tension sys-\ntem to work without using conscious thought to execute \nthe shot, some archers may wish to know what causes the \nrelease to fire. Continuing to pull on the release with back \ntension increases the pressure between the hand and the \nrelease because the compound is shot from the wall. The \nincrease in pressure causes the back of the hand to stretch. \nAs the hand stretches the thumb or trigger finger moves \nrearward at a rate that is faster than the rate that the release \nmoves. The trigger moves with the thumb or finger that it \nis in contact with. When the trigger moves far enough the \nstring is released. With a quality release this movement, \nchange in relationship between the hand and the release, \nis not typically visible or felt. Keep in mind that there"}

By doing this the coach is performing the function \nof the mental program for the archer. Once the proper \nmethod is learned and committed to the subconscious, \nthe archer may be taught to use a mental program in order \nto control the shot the way the coach did.\nFollow through\nShooting with back tension results in a “surprise” when \nthe shot goes off; therefore there is no need for conscious \nthought about follow through. An analogy for this is \npeople playing tug-o-war (pulling on opposite ends of a \nrope). If the rope were to break while people were pulling \non it, there will be a surprise. The people pulling will fall \nonto their backs, without time to react in any other way. \nThe bow moves straight toward the target that it is aimed \nat when the release goes off (the rope breaks). At the same \nmoment, the release hand moves straight away along the \nsame line. This occurs before the archer can react in any \nother way, allowing the arrow to leave the bow while eve-\nrything is still in perfect line. The result is perfect follow \nthrough. There is no need to exaggerate the motion of fol-\nlow through because the arrow is gone before the archer \nregains control after the surprise of the release. Again, no \nthought about follow through is necessary if the release is \nexecuted properly using back tension, resulting in a sur -\nprise. The perfect follow through is natural. The example \nof a rope breaking is an explanation used to demonstrate \nthat with a surprise we can not control the follow through \nuntil after the arrow leaves and it no longer matters. Just \nas the people on the rope eventually react to their fall, we \nalso react and re-grip the bow and regain control. This re-\naction occurs after the arrow has left, because of the ele-\nment of surprise. A true surprise release ensures that the \nshot is achieved while the archer is still aiming; hence the \nbow can propel the arrow away while visual and mental \nactivities of the archers are maintained and unchanged.\nThree outcomes of a shot\nThis section is a short restatement of what must happen \nwhen the archer draws the bow. This information is so im-\nportant that it is necessary it make it stand out from the \nother aspects of the shot. This is the “Keystone” of shoot-\ning properly with a mechanical release.\nThree things can occur once the bow is drawn. First, \nthe archer draws, anchors, aims and starts to pull. The pull \ncontinues with constant, even motion, never speeding up \nor slowing down, until the release goes off, surprising the \narcher and the arrow flies to the target. Second, the archer \ndraws, anchors, aims and starts to pull. The pull continues \nwith constant, even motion, never speeding up or slow -\ning down, until the shot has deteriorated so badly that the \narrow will not hit the target if it goes off. In this case the \narcher lets down and starts the shot over from the begin-\nning. This is still a perfect shot, as the archer still has the \nopportunity to execute the shot properly. The third oc-\ncurrence is the archer draws, anchors, aims and starts to \npull. The pull continues with constant even motion, nev -\ner speeding up or slowing down. This pull continues at \nthe constant rate for an eternity. In this third scenario, the \narcher is standing at full draw for the remainder of his or \nher life. Of course the third scenario never occurs. Even-\ntually all shots end in one of the first two results listed. If \nthe third scenario never occurs, then why include it? Sim-\nply put, in order for the shot to be successful, the archer \nmust intend to do number three every time the bow is \ndrawn back. The archer must have no expectation that \nthe bow will ever go off, this allows the surprise release to \noccur. With expectation comes anticipation. The archer \nmust have endless patience with every shot.\nBreathing\nAn archer should exhale when exerting the effort to draw a \nbow. Once at full draw the archer should aim and execute \nthe shot before taking another breath. This time while the \nlungs are empty is referred to as the natural respiratory \npause. It may seem difficult to spend this amount of time \nwithout breathing, but consider that we do not draw a \nbreath while talking, and we often talk for periods longer \nthan that required to execute a shot. An alternative to this \nis to draw a half or full breath after reaching full draw and \nholding that breath until the shot is completed.\n9. Tuning\nBasic Tuning\nAs listed in section three of this chapter, the assembly \nand set-up of the bow and components is the first step in \nthe tuning process. This step must be performed in order \nto learn to shoot with proper form. Once an archer has \nlearned how to execute shots with proper form, the tun-\ning process can resume."}

Using good form, shoot fletched arrows \nthrough the paper and into a target butt. The holes in the \npaper may then be analyzed to determine adjustments \nthat may be necessary to improve arrow flight.

Maintenance\nMaintenance suggestions\nBelow are several suggestions for the care and mainte-\nnance of a compound bow.\nReplace string and cables every year or two, or after \n15,000 to 20,000 shots. If string or cables show signs of \nfailure, replace immediately. String and cables should \nbe replaced as a set. It is recommended to mark the \ncams against the limbs at brace position after the bow \nis set-in (cable and string fully stretched). If any of the \nmarks moves from its original position, the bow must be \nchecked.\nInspect the bow and accessories for wear or damage \nprior to shooting.\nAll bolts and screws must be retightened regularly.\nDo not expose a compound bow to extreme heat. \nThe string, cables, and limbs in particular can be dam-\naged. This often occurs when a bow is left in a vehicle on \na warm day.\nAfter shooting in the rain, the bow should be left to \ndry under natural environment (in a ventilated and \nshaded place). Direct heating or sunlight is not recom-\nmended. The string and cable shall not be waxed until \nafter moisture in them has evaporated.

In \nfigure 1, the archer has the back of his chair well below \nthe level required by IPC but at a reasonable height to \ngive him some support.\nHeight of back seat\nSection 2 – W1 Class\nThe W1 class is also for archers who shoot from a wheel-\nchair but who have additional disabilities in the arms \nand hands. IPC rules allow them to use compound \nbows in a separate class from that for Open Compound \nusers but the bow must only have the same type of sight -\ning arrangement as the recurve bow (i.e. no peep sight \nor magnifying sight). Even with a compound, many \narchers in this class cannot reach 90 meters so, in inter -\nnational competition, they only shoot the women’s dis -\ntances (i.e. 70/60 rather than 90/70). Compound bows \nin this class have a different weight restriction from \nthat normally used in FITA. Men may only have a peak \nweight of 45 pounds and women 35 pounds. This is to \nmake the class fair to those who are not capable of pull-\ning the 60 pound maximum weight. All the information \nabout wheelchair’s in Section 1 is, of course, equally ap -\nplicable to this class. The principle additional challenge \nfaced by these archers is a lack of balance which could \nlead to them falling out of the chair on release. In order \nto avoid this, archers in this class are allowed, under IPC \nrules, to be strapped into the chair or use some kind of \nbody support on the chair.\nThe next figure shows an archer wearing a strap which \ngoes round his body and over one shoulder. What cannot \nbe seen is that the strap goes right round the back of the \nchair.\nThe other problem for this class of archers is the small \namount of mobility in the fingers. Usually, they cannot \nhold the string and must use some kind of release aid be-\ncause they do not have sufficient use of the fingers to be \nable to hold the string Most coaches will be familiar with \nthe type of release aid used by compound archers, but these \nneed more control from the archer than is possible for a W1 \narcher so most will adapt the release aid according to the \narcher’s needs. For some archers, the release aid needs to \nbe attached firmly to the archer’s hand so that they cannot \nbe dropped on release. The next figure shows the archer at-\ntaching his release aid by means of a Velcro strap.\nThe next figure shows an archer at full draw and the tight \nstrapping holding his release aid in place can be seen very \nclearly. This archer releases by turning his hand and the re-\nlease aid has been specially adapted so that he can do this."}

IPC \nrules allow them to use any type of chair, although there \nis a limit to the amount of space the chair can occupy on \nthe shooting line. However, they are not allowed to gain \nany support from the back of the chair so most use a stool \nwithout a back.\nChoosing the right type of seat and deciding the best \nheight for it are very important for ensuring that the \narcher has the best possible posture when shooting. On \nthe next two views of the same archer, you can see that \nthe stool is of a height which allows her to have her legs \nsloped downwards. A normal height chair would bend her \nlegs up much more which would not be comfortable for \nher.

The simplest is for it to be \nstrapped to the bow by a bandage but many archers \nhave developed quite hi-tech ways of doing this. The \nsolution will depend very much on how much of the \narm is still present. An arm that has been amputated \nbelow the elbow will allow the archer much more feel-\ning of what the bow is doing than one which is ampu-\ntated at the shoulder. There is no one solution and the \ncoach will need to work with the archer in trying out \nvarious ways of addressing the problem until a satis -\nfactory conclusion is reached."}

The duty of this helper \nis to act as the eyes of the VI, providing guidance in defin-\ning the arrow strike, safety in and around all venues used \nby the VI archer and provides basic equipment mainte-\nnance unable to be performed by the VI archer.\nIntroduction to the ‘tactile’ sight and ‘foot locators’\nThe tactile sight and foot locators allow the same assist -\nance that a conventional sight has for the mainstream \narcher. The foot locators give an acceptable stance over \nthe shooting line that is both comfortable and repeatable. \nWhen the foot locator positioning is completed the next \nstep is to place the tactile device in place linking it in to \nthe foot locators. It must be accepted here that foot loca-\ntor styles and tactile supports vary in design so you may \naccept that the design shown is purely the preference of \nthe ‘model’ archer.\nSTEP 1 – The tactile set-up for elevation and di-\nrection.\nWe must start by developing ‘line’ or ‘direction’ for the VI \narcher and the first step towards this is the laying down \nof the foot locators by, in this case, the ‘helper’ . The foot \nlocators initially will appear to be laid out pointing a little \noff centre as the V .I. archer will use the back of the bow \nhand as a reference and not a sight fitted to the bow riser.\nSTEP 2 – The next step is the addition of the tactile \n‘back of hand’ sight that will allow for ‘elevation’ .\nThe tactile stand shown here is a basic camera tri- pod. \nThe tactile sight is fixed to the top and can be adjusted \nfor elevation and windage. T o prevent the tripod moving \nwhen the archer places sideward pressure onto the sight \nhead the stand is pegged or weighted down.\nIn this example an elastic rope is pegged into the ground \nto provide the required stability. Next figure shows the \ntactile unit and foot locations before the preliminary ad-\njustment is made for direction. It must be pointed out \nhere that this tactile sight touches the back of the hand. \nUnlike the mainstream bow sight this device will give the \nimpression that your archer will shoot left as the sight \nhead is some seven to ten centimetres to the left of where \nthe fixed bow sight would be. This photograph must be ac-\ncepted as showing only preliminary setting and pegging.\nThe VI archer now has been provided with the two basic \nplanes required to shoot with some degree of accuracy. \nThe tactile sight head shown here has a spring-loaded \nbutton as a tactile point of contact. All tactiles of this style"}

Next figure shows the final step of \nthe preliminary set-up, which is the levelling of the tac-\ntile sighting head. This becomes particularly important \noutdoors where the ground is seldom level and caters for \nvariables, which the tripod is unable to overcome.\nWith the V .I. specific equipment now basically set up the \ntime has come for the archer to take up position where \nthe helper can view the set-up and correct any obvious er-\nrors in alignment. If all looks well at this point the equip -\nment is ready for practice arrows to be shot. The ability of \nthe VI’s helper and archer to work as a team is important \nat this point as ‘careless’ set up will act only as a disincen-\ntive to the archer who relies heavily on the helper at this \nearly stage.\nThe archer should now take up position in the foot \nmarkers. It is better, although unusual at first, for the \narchers to ‘back into’ the type of foot markers shown, as \nthis has been found to provide a much more secure and \nduplicable stance.\nThe archer has now developed the basic line that should \nensure the maximum chance of an initial hit on the boss \nonce elevation is set up for the venue. The archer, using \nthe back of the hand will position a knuckle joint on the \nball of the tactile. Not all tactile sights use the ball but \nmost VI archers find that it provides the most comfort -\nable and accurate contact method between the sight and \nhand. Please note that it is illegal to position the ball BE -\nTWEEN the fingers as this can be interpreted as ‘hold-\ning’ the tactile. In this example the VI archer positions her \nfeet to the right of the guides but this is personal prefer -\nence and it is equally acceptable if the archer has both feet \nwithin or outside the guides. Although it is difficult to see \nin these photographs, the guides are adjustable.\nThe next figure demonstrates the common position of \nthe tactile sight on the hand of the archer.\nIt may be noticed here that the clearance between any part \nof the bow and the tactile minimises the possibility of any \ncontact between the two. The tactile in this example has \nall the adjustments that a mainstream sight would have. \nThe ability for elevation is carried by the screw adjust -\nment on the top of the sight and the ‘windage’ is taken up \nusing the set-up screw on the left of the button carriage.\nThe next figure shows the detailed contact area."}

The exception for the VI archer \nis the ability to control body sway as it is quite possible \nthat with little or no vision they will have difficulty de-\ntecting the sway before it becomes a source of lost points. \nOften, once attention is drawn to this and the archer is \naware it is possible to correct. One thing to consider is \nthe archer’s footwear. Different types of shoes / boots can \nhelp to alleviate the problem and it is worth experiment -\ning with different styles.\nIf the archer is a novice it will be advisable to work \nwith them closely without the benefit of the tactile sight \nand foot locators in order to develop good basic skills as \nwould be expected of any other archer.\nHead position is as important to the visually impaired \narcher as any other, and the archer should be encouraged \nto develop good head positioning even though no vision \nis possible.\nWhen the archer is introduced to the use of the tactile \nsight it is recommended that the archer be encouraged to \ncome to full draw before contacting the tactile. It is all too \neasy for the archer to attempt to fit their stance to the tac-\ntile rather than use the tactile correctly.\nT oo much sideways hand pressure onto the tactile \nhead may result in inconsistent arrow strike. The tactile \nsight must be spring-loaded which will magnify poor \ntechnique in the use of the sight.\nOn a technical issue, the archer may find difficulty in \n‘nocking’ the arrow onto the string. This will be difficult \nnot because the archer cannot see to do this but in detect-\ning which way the ‘cock’ fletching is pointing.\nThe three next figures give some fletching variations \nthat have been used successfully. Please note the ‘four’ \nfletched arrows. As many VI’s shoot short distance \nrounds (30 meters) where the target face size is changed \nto simulate distance change, the four fletch arrow allows \nconfident nocking point alignment as no ‘cock’ vane ex -\nists. The four fletch arrow displays good flight character -\nistics at these shorter distances.\nOther methods of using conventional three fletch arrows \nexist, e.g. cutting a ‘nick’ in the cock vane.\nOr, a mark can be made on the shaft near the nock with a \n‘blob’ of glue or correction fluid.\nEach method allows the archer to shoot with confidence.\nWe have mentioned the value of a dedicated ‘helper’ as -\nsisting the VI archer and also mentioned that most VI’s \ndo have some vision. For those VI’s who have never had \nmuch vision from birth, or those who lost vision early in \nlife, the concept of the ‘boss’ or the ‘T arget’ may be dif -\nficult to imagine. For these archers a method of provid-\ning a sense of the accuracy of a hit may be more than the \nnormal ‘clock face / colour’ description. 2 o’clock red \nmay have much value to you or me, but not to a VI arch-\ner with little vision from birth. In these cases we need to"}

Pro -\nvided you have an agreement where ‘top’ is on the target \nand the hand, you have a method of representing a hit. \nYou may also have a ‘peg-board’ option where the board \nhas holes cut to indicate various parts of the target and \na peg, or pegs, to indicate where the arrow strikes. The \npossibilities are numerous and only the desire to help is \nneeded to arrive at a solution that is agreeable to the VI \nand those helping.\nSection 5 – Other Issues:\nSections 1 to 4 have given the coach some advice on the \nsolutions to the major challenges that he will face when \ncoaching archers with a disability. It is, however, far from \na comprehensive guide as archers may have one or more \nof the disabilities discussed or other difficulties which \nmay not have been mentioned. There are other points \nwhich need to be considered.\n1. The archer’s disability may cause him to tire more \nquickly than other archers. The coach should discuss \nthis with the archer and bear it in mind when working \nout a training regime.\n2. T etraplegics cannot regulate their body temperatures \nin the same way as other people. This means that they \ndo not sweat in hot temperatures and their extremi-\nties can become excessively cold in cold weather. The \ncoach needs to keep an eye on this so that the archer \ndoes not get either heat stroke or hypothermia.\n3. Many wheelchair archers are reluctant to keep up their \nfluid intake during events because of the difficulty of \naccess of some toilet facilities. It is vital that they drink \nsuitable quantities during the course of the day so the \ncoach needs to ensure that they are aware of this and to \nencourage them to drink both water and sports drinks.\nThe important thing to remember is that archers with a \ndisability will be as enthusiastic about and committed to \ntheir sport as any other archer. If the coach and archer \nwork together to surmount any obstacles the archer has \nin achieving their potential, there are no limits to what can \nbe achieved. So, don’t be afraid to coach them and you will \ngain great satisfaction from their enjoyment of our sport."}

This line up accuracy will be rewarded by finding the \ncentre of the target within the first few arrows.\nWhen a visually impaired archer’s feet locators and \ntactile sight are being lined up ready for a training session \nor competition there are many areas that need consider -\ning to ensure that complete accuracy, when shooting, is \nachieved.\nIf the archer uses a tactile sighting aid on a tripod and \nthe knuckle of the bow hand as the tactile sight contact \npoint, the angles of the ground and vertical alignment of \nthe body must be fully considered.\nWhen shooting indoors the floor is flat, this is a con-\nstant that makes the visually impaired archer’s task of be-\ning able to establish a constant stance and balance of the \nbody relatively easy. But, when shooting outdoors this \ntask can become quite a challenge when getting all the \nangles right to get the first arrow to land in, or, near to \nthe gold.\nWhen shooting outdoors, even though the field may \nseem flat, the ground at the shooting line may slope ei-\nther upward or downward, even a slight slope will change \nthe visually impaired archer’s total line up and make their \ntask a little more difficult when shooting.

This line up accuracy will be rewarded by finding the \ncentre of the target within the first few arrows.\nWhen a visually impaired archer’s feet locators and \ntactile sight are being lined up ready for a training session \nor competition there are many areas that need consider -\ning to ensure that complete accuracy, when shooting, is \nachieved.\nIf the archer uses a tactile sighting aid on a tripod and \nthe knuckle of the bow hand as the tactile sight contact \npoint, the angles of the ground and vertical alignment of \nthe body must be fully considered.\nWhen shooting indoors the floor is flat, this is a con-\nstant that makes the visually impaired archer’s task of be-\ning able to establish a constant stance and balance of the \nbody relatively easy. But, when shooting outdoors this \ntask can become quite a challenge when getting all the \nangles right to get the first arrow to land in, or, near to \nthe gold.\nWhen shooting outdoors, even though the field may \nseem flat, the ground at the shooting line may slope ei-\nther upward or downward, even a slight slope will change \nthe visually impaired archer’s total line up and make their \ntask a little more difficult when shooting. With considera-\ntion and the right tools, the task of total line up for the \nvisually impaired archer can be relatively simple and very \naccurate.\nMethods of Line-Up and Aiming\nFor sighted archers there are three main types of shooting \nline-up, Straight Line, T riangle and Quadrilateral.\nStraight Line\nThis is the simplest form where the fingers grip the string \ntwo or three inches below the arrow and when at full draw \nthe archer looks along the arrow and aligns it with the re-\nquired aiming point, making one simple in-line line-up \npoint.

The eye lines up the point of \nthe arrow with the required aiming point. This requires \nthree line up points, the eye, arrow nock and the arrow \npoint. String alignment is also required when using this \nmethod. See figure 2.\nFigure 2.\nQuadrilateral\nthis method is also known as the eye, sight, arrow rela-\ntionship (ESAR) alignment procedure which introduces \nfour line up points, the eye, arrow nock, sight ring and \narrow point. String alignment is essential when using this \nmethod. This quadrilateral method is widely used and is a \nfavourite with recurve freestyle archers. See figure 3.\nFigure 3.\nWith visually impaired archers there is another type of \nline up. This is also a quadrilateral method but the area \nof concern is trapezoidal, in this case the line-up points \nare; the facial reference point, the feet, the body align-\nment (in all planes) and the tactile sight (in all planes), \nusing these reference points the area of alignment be-\ncomes much greater. Also, the angles become more criti-\ncal when aligning up the tactile equipment and the archer \nwho is to perform. See figure 4.\n Figure 4."}

Firstly, the shape of the archer’s \nbody is very important and a method of total balance \nmust be determined.\nIf the archer is heavy in the frontal area i.e. has a large \nchest or paunch when standing upright the body will be \nleaning slightly back to compensate for this. Also, the \nhead position will have an effect. With some people the \nhead can be positioned to the front of the torso, this will \nalso have a bearing on a balanced upright stance. There \nare several methods of determining an upright stance but \nhere is one method used in field archery which is quick \nand effective:\nHave the archer stand as upright but comfortable as • \npossible.\nHave them (keeping the body straight) lean back onto • \nthe heels until the toes want to lift off the ground.\nThen have them bring their body back to the upright • \nposition until the weight of the body is equally spread \nalong the feet from the heels to the balls of the feet. \nThis distance of movement at the chin may be anything \nfrom 3 to 5 inches (75 mm to 12.5 mm), which will de-\npend on the size and shape of the body. See figure 5.\nLeaning back \nonto the heels.\nStanding upright.\nCentre line \nof the body \nwhen \nstanding \nupright.\nFigure 5.\nWith practice the archer can get very proficient at getting \na constant balance which will enhance their chances of \nproducing good form and performances.\nGeneral Information\nIt is important that each individual archer’s foot locator \nis set to the correct location. T o do this there are some \nmeasurements that need to be established, these measure-\nments will be personalised and different for each archer.\nFrom here on each part of the archer’s body and \nequipment will determine ‘from where’ , ‘to where’ , the \nmeasurements will be made. So, although each section of \nthis document has its own heading, consideration must \nbe given as each part of the equipment being used by in-\ndividuals as it will have a bearing on these measurements, \nas will the archer’s footwear.\nFirstly we need to establish what kind of tactile sight \nis being used and the contact location point the archer \nfavours.\nIn this explanation I will describe the use of a wooden \nfoot locator and a tripod fitted with a ball and plunger \ntype tactile device where contact is between the first and \nsecond knuckles on the bow hand. This position will \ngive a more consistent line-up than having the contact \npoint between the second and third or the third and forth \nknuckles. The further the contact point is away from the \nfirst finger the greater the importance the angle of the \nbow hand becomes which will have an effect on the left/\nright accuracy.\nIt is advisable for the archer to wear the same footwear \nfor each training session and competition. If different \nfootwear is worn for training or competition the measure-\nments and balance of the archer could be jeopardised.\nFeet Locator Line-Up\nWe need to establish how far the arrow line is forward of \nthe body centre line when the archer is standing upright, \nfully balanced and at the full draw position. This measure-\nment will be used as a baseline and must be as accurate as \npossible. See figure 6."}

The T:E ratio greater than four (4) to \none (1) in the urine is an Adverse Analytical Finding.\nHormones and related Substances (S2)\nErytropoietin (EPO)\nEPO is a substance which enhances the production of red \nblood cells to increase the oxygen content in the blood. \nis a glucoprotein produced by kidney to regulate the \nproduction of red blood cells in the bone marrow. Red \ncells comprise around 42% of blood (haematocrit), the \nreminder being plasma. If haematocrit is high, EPO pro -\nduction is reduced. Recombinant EPO was produced in \nthe late 1980’s primarily to treat the anemia of renal fail-\nure. EPO enhances endurance performance in the same \nmanner as blood doping. EPO is prohibited since 1990.\nAdverse effects of erytropoietin include hypertension, \nthrombosis, iron deficiency, skin rash, a “flu-like” condi-\ntion, palpitation, hypertensive encephalopaty and nausea.\nGrowth hormon (Hgh) and Insuline-like Growth \nFactor (IGF-1)\nHuman Growth Hormone is a natural hormon that stim-\nulates growth, promotes protein synthesis and breaks \ndown fat (lipolysis). HGH is prescribed for children or \nadults with growth hormon deficiency. Recombinant hu-\nman growth hormon become available in the 1980’s and \nits use prohibited since 1988.\nInsuline-like growth factor is believed to increase the \nglycogen deposit in the muscle and increase lean body \nmass.\nGonadotropins (hCG and LH)\nIt is prohibited in males only, as it stimulates testosterone \nproduction. Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) is a glyc-\noprotein that is produced in large quantities in women \nsoon after conception. It plays a vital role in maintaining \na normal pregnancy. It has been used by males to stimu-\nlate testosterone production and to prevent the shutdown \nof testosterone and sperm production that accompanies \nlong term use of AAS, therefore it is prohibited in males \nonly.\nThe biological action of chorionic gonadotropin \n(hCG) are identical to those of luteinizing hormone \n(LH) which is also involved in the regulation of testo -\nsterone production in men, therefore is also prohibited \nin males only.\nCorticotropins\nCorticotropins (ACTH, tetrocosactide) have been mis -\nused to increase the blood levels of endogenous gluco -\ncorticosteroids, notably to obtain the euphoric effect of \nthese drugs. The administration of ACTH or tetracosac-\ntide is considered equivalent to the oral, intramuscular or \nintravenous application of glucocorticosteroids.\nBeta 2-agonists (S3)\nPhysicians prescribe Beta-2 agonists primarily for bron-\nchospasm in asthma and other airways diseases All Beta-2 \nagonists (including their D- and L-isomers) are prohib -\nited except formeterol, salbutamol, salmeterol and terbu-\ntalin when administered by inhalation to treat asthma, \nwhich require a medical justification in accordance with \nthe WADA International Standard for Therapeutic Use \nExemption.\nAgents with anti-oestrogenic activity (S4)\nAromatase inhibitors, Selective Estrogen Receptors \nModulators such as tamoxifen, and other anti-estrogenic \nsubstances such as clomiphene and cyclofenil are prohib-\nited.\nDiuretics and Masking agents (S5)\nMasking agents are products that have the potential to \nimpair the excretion of Prohibited Substances, to conceal \ntheir presence in urine or other “Samples” used in doping \ncontrol, or to change haematological parameters.\nThe main masking agent are Diuretics which increases \nthe excretion of water and electrolytes (especially sodium \nand potassium) from the body via the kidneys.\nDiuretics may be used by competitors for the two \nmain reasons. Firstly, in weight classified sports to reduce \nweight rapidly. Secondly, athletes attempt to dilute urine, \nmaking it more difficult for laboratory to detect some \nprohibited substances that they have been using.\nAdverse effects of diuretics include excessive weight \nloss, hypotension, low or high serum potassium, cardiac \narythmia, muscle cramps, increased uric acid and possi-\nbly an attack of gout, reduced capacity for muscle func-\ntion and death."}

Erytropoietin, \nperfluorochemicals, efaproxiral (RSR13), modified hae-\nmoglobin products) are prohibited.\nPharmacological, chemical and physical manipula-\ntion (M2)\nThis consists in tampering, or attempting to tamper, in \norder to alter the integrity and validity of specimens col-\nlected during doping controls. This includes methods \nsuch as catheterisation, urine substitution and/or altera-\ntion, inhibition of renal excretion and alterations of testo-\nsterone and epitestosterone concentrations. Intravenous \ninfusions are also prohibited.\nGene Doping (M3)\nGene or cell doping is defined as the non-therapeutic use \nof genes, genetic elements and/or cells that have the ca-\npacity to enhance athletic performance.\n3.2 Substances and Methods prohibited In-Com-\npetition only\nStimulants (S6)\nMankind has used stimulants for thousands of years for \ntheir energizing properties. The early history of doping \nis dominated by reports of amphetamine, cocaine and \nstrychnine incidents and later on of less potent stimu-\nlants such as ephedrine. These drugs are available either \nin foods and drinks or in over-the-counter (OTC) prepa-\nrations.\nThe common feature of those substances is stimula-\ntion of the brain and all nerves of the body.\nIn high doses amphetamine disrupts co-ordination \nand produces aggressive behaviour, hallucinations, sei-\nzures, hypertension and cardiac arythmias. Long term \nuse results in a tolerance and physical dependance.\nNarcotics (S7)\nAmong them is morphine which is a natural ingredient of \nopium. After processing, morphine can be converted to \nheroin, a highly addictive substance and a leading drug of \nabuse. Narcotics are widely used as analgesics (painkillers).\nSeveral weaker narcotics are permitted including co -\ndeine, dextrapropoxyphene, pholcodine and tramadol. \nThose drugs are much less powerful than morphine and \nrarely lead to addiction.\nThe most serious side effects of powerful narcotics are \ndue to physical dependance and the development of with-\ndrawal symptoms. Heroine is the most addictive narcotic.\nCannabinoids (S8)\nCannabinoids include both marijuana (the dried leaves \nand flowers of the Cannabis Satura plant) and hashish \n(the dried resin extract from the leaves). In the sport of \narchery, due to their effects such as anxiety reduction and \nincrease of self confidence, cannabinoids are considered \nto be performance-enhancers.\nWhile cannabinoids are only tested in competition, \nthe active substances are retained in fatty tissues within \nvarious organs of the body. Therefore, depending on the \nstrength of the substance taken, the route of administra-\ntion and the frequency of use, the metabolite may be de-\ntected in an athlete’s urine sample for several weeks when \nused heavily and frequently, and for ten or more days after \na single exposure. A concentration of THC (tetrahydro -\ncannabinol) greater than 15 nanograms/ml constitutes an \nAdverse Analytical Finding.\nGlucocorticosteroids (S9)\nGlucocorticosteroids are a class of drugs best known for \ntheir ant-inflammatory effects. They are widely used in \nmedicine to reduce pain and inflammation associated \nwith various joint and skin conditions. Glucocorticoster-\noids are invaluable to manage asthma and allergic disor -\nders and diseases of the immune system.\nGlucocorticosteroids are secreted by adrenal glands \nthat regulate the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins \nand fats.\nHowever, use of glucocorticosteroids require medical \ncontrol because they may cause severe side effects.\nRecently, there has been a rise in non-therapeutic use \nof glucocorticosteroids by athletes during competition.\n3.3 Other Substances prohibited in archery\nOn top of the above, FITA prohibits the use of the follow-\ning substances.\nAlcohol\nAlcohol in anything other than small quantities depresses \nbrain function which reduces tension, inhibition and self \ncontrol, increases confidence and the tendency to take \na risk or actions. As alcohol consumption continues, \njudgment, co-ordination and reactions are increasingly \nimpaired."}

It is \nmore commonly used to reduce stress/tension and hand \ntremor which would be beneficial in sports requiring ac-\ncuracy such as bow shooting.\nIt can also increase self confidence resulting in an \nincreased chance of taking a risk or acting in a way that \ncompetitor would not normally. This could put both the \ncompetitor and other competitors at risk.\nThe issue of alcohol misuse in sport is complex due \nto wide spread use (and abuse) of alcohol in the general \ncommunity.\nBeta-Blockers\nBeta-blockers act by blocking the effect of natural stimu-\nlants (catecholamine) on the beta adrenergic receptors. \nThese receptors are located in the heart, lungs and blood \nvessels. Beta-blockers were prohibited in 1985 because \nathletes used them for alleged medical reasons to en-\nhance performance in shooting events. It is considered \nthat beta-blockers enhance performance by reducing \ntremulousness, anxiety and tachycardia (fast heart rate) \nthat athletes experience just before a competition. Con-\nversely, beta-blockers impair performance in endurance \nevents because they block the increase in heart rate and \nthus cardiac output necessary to perform to one’s maxi-\nmum.\nAdverse effect of beta-blockers include bradycardia \n(slow heart rate), inability to increase cardiac output \nwhen exercising, fatigue, depression and asthma.\nIn archery, the use of beta-blockers is prohibited in-\ncompetition and also out-of-competition,\n3.4 The case of nutritional supplements\nIn order to meet the nutritional needs requested by their \ntraining regimen, many athletes use dietary/nutritional \nsupplements. However there has been some evidence \nthat some products may not contain the amount of ingre-\ndient listed on the label, may not contain the ingredient \nlisted at all, or may be adulterated with other prohibited \nsubstances not listed on the label.\nDoping control authorities can not judge intent. They \ncan only judge what is found in the body, Ultimately, ath-\nletes are responsible for what they ingest, so it is possible \nthat the use of some nutritional supplements could lead \nto an athlete being found guilty of a doping rule viola-\ntion.\nIt is WADA’s and FITA’s position that taking a poorly \nlabelled nutritional supplement should not be regarded \nas an adequate defence in a doping hearing. Moreover, \nbeing concerned about inadequate labeling and insuf -\nficient quality control in the production of many nutri-\ntional supplements, WADA officially recommends not to \ntake nutritional supplements.\n4. Therapeutic Use Exemption Procedures\nAthletes with a documented medical condition requiring \nthe use of a prohibited substance or a prohibited method \nmust first obtain a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE).\nExemption can be granted only in strict accordance \nwith the following main criteria:\n– the athlete would experience significant impairment \nto health if the prohibited substance or method were \nto be withheld in the course of treating an acute or \nchronic medical condition.\n– the therapeutic use of the prohibited substance or \nmethod would produce no additional enhancement \nof performance other than that which might be antici-\npated by a return to a state of normal health following \nthe treatment of a legitimate medical condition.\n– there is no reasonable therapeutic alternative to the \nuse of the otherwise prohibited substance or method\n– an application for a TUE will not be considered for \nretroactive approval, except in cases where emergency \ntreatment was necessary, or if, due to exceptional cir -\ncumstances, there was insufficient time or opportu-\nnity for an applicant to submit an application prior to \na doping control\nDepending on the Athlete’s status the applications for a \nTUE are to be sent to FITA- or its partner service provid-\ner (the Swedish T esting Service Provider IDTM in 2007), \nor the National Anti-Doping Organisation (NADO) of \nthe Athlete’s country.

They practice the so called ‘instinctive’ style of \nshooting. Howard Hill, one of the best instinctive arch-\ners ever, described his way of aiming as ‘split vision’ or \nsecondary aiming. If you point with your index finger to -\nwards a target and keep focused on the target with your \neyes, you can move your finger up and down but you still \nwill see it in your range of vision, be it blurred.\nThere are, on a national level, more disciplines such as \nthe Recurve or Freestyle unlimited, Compound limited \nand unlimited, as well as different Bow Hunter styles.\nEach time when shooting at a given distance, notice \nwhere in your range of vision, your finger can still be \nseen. Remember this and practice as often as possible on \ndifferent distances and different objects. This is in a way \nsubconscious ‘gap shooting’ which is aiming high or low \nto compensate for the distance.\nShooting field archery with a recurve or compound \nbow is basically the same as shooting target archery and \nsome good target archers became a good field archer. \nThere are however a lot of characteristics in field archery, \nthat are unknown in target archery:\nShooting takes place in natural surrounding (forest, \nhills, etc.).\nThe archer has to shoot uphill and downhill and must \nknow by experience how much to subtract from or add \nto the (estimated) distance to aim correct and hit the tar-\nget.\nThe archer has to shoot at targets that are not perpen-\ndicular to the aiming line, which gives specific results if \nmissing the centre of the spot (the highest scoring point \non the target).\nThe archer has to recognize different target faces and \nhas to estimate their position in the field.\nThere is no direct visibility of most of the competi-\ntors, the scoring of competitors during the course is un-\nknown.\nField archery round\nThere are 24 targets to be shot by each archer. The targets \nare of different size and at different moderate shooting \ndistances spread over the area. The archers go round the \ncourse in groups of four.\nA morning assembly of all participants, one of the organ-\nizers will act as an escort to take each group to their first \ntarget in the field. The thrill of encountering new shoot -\ning conditions is typical for a field archery round.\nA shooting position in the field is marked with a wooden \npeg at some distance from the target. The Recurve and \nthe Compound divisions shoot from the red pegs, the \nBare Bow, Cadet Recurve and Cadet Compound divi-\nsions shoot from blue pegs and the Cadet Bare Bow divi-\nsion shoots from yellow pegs."}

The \nbow hunter caught his prey by shooting instinctively, \nwithout even having the time for conscious aiming; bare \nbow archers use a fixed point on the bow or arrow to give \nthe bow the necessary elevation by bringing this point on \nthe virtual line between the eye and the target, which is \nthe essence of aiming.\nModern bows have a special aiming device, the sight. \nA sight is a sliding device adjusted on the bow with which \na fixed aiming point called sight pin can be fixed in place \nin order to give the bow the desired elevation during aim-\ning.\nA sight has a ruler with a scale usually indicating cen-\ntimetres, millimetres and tenths of millimetres. The scale \ncan indicate for instance from 0.00 cm to 9.00 cm. De-\npending on how the archer mounted the sight, the point \nof zero elevation (shooting straight forward) is some-\nwhere at the top of the ruler.\nIn target archery we need only four marks on the scale \nof the sight, one for each distance. In field archery we \nhave to shoot any distance between five and sixty meters \nand it is not possible consequently to have each distance \nmarked on the sight. It is recommended to put some \nmarks on the sight bar and to keep a table of sight marks \nbetween 5 and 60 meters on a piece of paper in the pock-\net. A field archer needs to know his sight marks at every \n2.5 meter on the shorter distances and at every 5 meter \non the longer distances. Confidence in performance for \nfield archers strongly depends on their confidence in their \ntable of sight marks."}

The reason for this is probably because \nhis sight bar is set parallel to his sight window (bow riser) \nbut he is holding the bow slightly tilted, which is quite \nnormal and often preferred. It is preferred because your \nnormal body line often makes it natural to hold the bow \ntilted and if resisting this natural stance you will have to \nforce your body, or arm/shoulder into a position which is \nnot natural and which may implement muscle strain and/\nor shooting errors. On a target round this need for side \nadjustment is not a big problem, but for a field archer this \nadjusting would be hopeless to keep track of, and thus we \nmust correct our equipment accordingly.\nHave someone help you to check by eyesight or by \nmeans of a level instrument that your sight ruler is ver -\ntical when you shoot – it doesn’t matter how much you \ntilt your bow. As long as the ruler of your sight is vertical \nthere will be no need for horizontal adjustment on dif -\nferent distances. (Depending of course, as long as you \ndo not change the degree you tilt your bow). Tilting the \nbow, even the compound bow, may be an advantage to \nmost archers. However, there may be one problem if you \ntilt the bow too much to the left (right handed archer) \nyou may discover that by keeping the sight bar vertical \nthe sight pin/ring may be hidden behind the riser on the \nlonger distances. If this becomes a problem you will have \nto alter the bow grip or your shooting technique in order \nto limit the bow tilt.\nField archers must hit a small spot on distances from \n5 meter and onwards, and therefore the bow/arrow com-\nbination should be well tuned so that the arrows leave the \nstring as straight as possible.\nDraw a horizontal line on your target or stick a nar -\nrow, good visible line of tape and shoot an arrow at that \nline from every meter between 5 and 10 and from every \n2.5 meter between 10 and 20. Use the correct sight marks. \nMeasure only the deviation from the (horizontal) line. If \nyour arrows hit close to the horizontal line on those dis -\ntances, they fly close to the horizontal plane. (See Manual \n1 for ‘horizontal’ plane).\nNext, tape a vertical line and shoot from every 1 meter \nbetween 5 and 10 and from every 2.5 meter between 10 \nand 20. Measure the deviation from the vertical line only. \nIf your arrows hit close to the vertical line on those dis -\ntances, they fly close to the vertical shooting plane.\nIf your arrows fly close to the horizontal and the shoot-\ning planes, they will also fly straight on longer distances. \nIf you are unable to hit the horizontal and/or vertical \ntape on the shorter distances it may mean your arrows are \n‘wobbling’ too much and that you must continue tuning \n(optimising) your equipment.\nChapter 3.\nRange Finding\nDead ground, such as where archers are looking over a \nridge at a target and can’t see the ground area between \nthem and the target, or shooting over water, are notori-\nously difficult situations to estimate distance. The same \nis true, to lesser extent, when shooting across a valley \nwhere the direct distance is very different to the ground \ndistance."}

Good intuition and terrain evaluation \nis not enough, as these are too inaccurate.\nUnmarked distances are not completely unknown. \nAccording to the rules, unmarked targets can only be \nmounted between certain distances.\nNumber\nof\n12 \ntargets \nin a unit \nmax – \nmin #\nDiameter \nof Field \nFaces in \ncm\nDistances in Meters (unmarked)\nYellow Peg\nCadet Bare \nBow\nBlue Peg\nBarebow, \nCadet \nRecurve, \nCadet \nCompound \nRed Peg\nRecurve and\nCompound\n2–4\n2–4\n2–4\n2–4\nØ 20\nØ 40\nØ 60\nØ 80\n5–10\n10–15\n15–25\n20–35\n5–10\n10–20\n15–30\n30–45\n10–15\n15–25\n20–35\n35–55\nNumber\nof\nTargets\nDiameter\nof Field \nFaces\nin cm\nDistances in Meters (marked)\nYellow Peg\nCadet\nBarebow\nBlue Peg\nBarebow, \nCadet \nRecurve, \nCadet \nCompound \nRed Peg\nRecurve \nand\nCompound\n3\n3\n3\n3\nØ 20\nØ 40\nØ 60\nØ 80\n5–10–15\n10–15–20\n20–25–30\n30–35–40\n5–10–15\n15–20–25\n30–35–40\n40–45–50\n10–15–20\n20–25–30\n35–40–45\n50–55–60\nThe distance of an 80 cm target face for instance from the \nshooting position of Recurve and compound archers is \nbetween 35 and 55 meters, and just by using the knowl-\nedge of the rules an archer can estimate the distance at \n45 meters, which is obviously within 10 meter of the real \ndistance. Although this is ranging the distance very basic, \nthe archers have already a guess that gets the arrow on the \nbutt. The 80cm target face is really the most complicated \ntarget on the unmarked round and it is clear that archers \nare happy to hit at least the butt.\nGenerally speaking it is the longer distances the archer \nneeds to concentrate on for guessing. Archers may well \nhave trouble in getting high scores at shorter distances and \nsmaller targets, but most probably this has to do with the \narcher’s bow tuning and technique, more than distance \nmeasuring. At the shorter distances, the extent of compen-\nsation is by far less, especially when using a fast bow. Also, \nthe smaller targets are easier to be recognized, especially in \nFITA rounds, so they will not confuse the archers.\nIn the unmarked round it’s the 60 cm and 80 cm target \nfaces, which can cause the archer some concern in decid-\ning which size face they are about to shoot at.\nShooting a lot of field competitions on unmarked dis -\ntances will give the archers more and more experience, \nwhich also allows them to achieve higher scores.\nThe FITA rules clearly state that the use of range find-\ning devices is not allowed. It is not possible however to \nprevent archers from measuring the distance to the target \nby applying their common equipment."}

The measuring methods men-\ntioned below do not use exceptional devices for range \nfinding.\nArchers are allowed to use any information from the \nRules. So, they can have a list of all the distances each tar-\nget must be set in for each bow style. The archer can come \nto full draw and then compare the size of a special part of \nthe bow with the known size of the target face.\nIt is indeed possible to estimate the distance to the tar -\nget very accurately using previous tests during practic-\ning. This type of estimating is actually not according to \nthe spirit of the rules, but it is difficult to prove it is being \nused.\nArchers are not allowed to discuss distances on the \ncourse, to prevent them from giving advice or mislead-\ning information to other competitors. The use of mobile \nphones or radio technique is prohibited for the same rea-\nson. Archers are not allowed to pace out the distance be-\ntween pegs as they go to their own shooting peg to take \nup their position. (For example the bare bow archer go -\ning to their peg while passing the red peg).\nField archers need to find their own method of esti-\nmating distances (range finding) and this needs to be \npracticed as part of their shooting form. Whatever meth-\nod of estimating the archer chooses to apply, there are \nalso special factors to take into account.\nThe course setter is pitting their wits against archers, \nand will try everything to confuse the archer. Course set-\nters don’t like to make the target size obvious. They use \ntricks such as putting a small target face on a small butt, \nmaking it look like a large target face on a normal size \nbutt. It is important to know the course setter as each of \nthem has their own ‘signature’ .\nThe more field practice the archers do the more they \nget a feeling for distance, and how to reliably estimate \ndistances. With increasing experience they will be able to \ntake advantage out of every single hint or sign in the sur -\nroundings to improve their skills in estimating distances \nas exact as possible.\nPractice exercises for range finding:\nA. During practice in the field the following task is in-\nstructive for the archer.\n1. Note the first thought about the distance that came \nup arriving at the peg.\n2. Note the distance which was decided to shoot the \narrow.\n3. Measure and note the true distance.\n Experience shows that in about 95% of all cases the \nfirst thought is correct, but is followed by a different \ndecision due to doubt.\nB. Judging by feel means that archers learn to judge the \ndistance by ‘feeling’ the size of the target in relation to \nthe distance. In order to do this they need to practice \na lot, but below you will see a few suggestions: T ake \ndifferent T arget Deer / T arget faces glued onto card-\nboard and place them in the field and let archers judge \nthe distance and then measure them yourself.\nC. Notice the different sizes of field faces, animal faces \nor 3D deer on various distances (start with the maxi-\nmum distances), shoot at the targets while getting ac-\ncustomed with their sizes.\nD. Locate the targets or 3D deer in the field, judge the dis-\ntance by ‘feeling’ , shoot at them, measure the distance \nusing a measuring-line or by counting steps. Always \nremember the maximum distance for that particular \ntarget face, animal face or 3D deer according to the \nrules. (Archers may be fooled, try to judge by the spot \nsize rather than the size of the whole target face). It is \ncommon to judge the distance too short!\nE. A useful distance training exercise is that you and your \narchers take a suitable measure-line or distance finder \nand go for a walk in the countryside, woods or moun-\ntains. Challenge the archers to guess the distance to \nnominated trees, plants or objects. Then check their \naccuracy by measuring.\nF. Learn how distances of 10 meters look like in various \nterrain."}

Judge the dis -\ntance to an object somewhere in between archer and \nthe target. Notice how this object is situated in rela-\ntion to the target.\nThen you move your head sideways and notice how that \nobject moves relatively to the target. If it moves just a lit -\ntle bit, the distance between object and target is small, if \nit moves equal to your head movement it is half way in \nbetween, and if it moves more than your head, the object \nis nearer than halfway to the target.\nI. If an archer has to shoot prior to you, then you listen \nhow much time it takes between the release and arrow \nimpact on the target and estimate the distance. This \ntechnique needs a lot of experience but can be very \naccurate.\nJ. Archers can get some information looking through \ntheir binoculars at arrow holes punched in the target \nface or 3D deer.

An archer might therefore \ndeduce that the target is further away than it looks like. If \nthe archer is not the first one in their group to shoot they \nmight get confirmation of this observation by watching \nwhere the arrow of the target partner hits, weighing this \nagainst their (assumed) ability.

Most of this information is reassurance, rather than a \ndead give away and, rather than to seek it, occurs dur-\ning the shoot.\nL. The archer estimates the distance between the target \nand a tree let’s say–15 meters in the example below.\nThen they estimate the distance between the tree and \nthem self –20 meters in this example. Hence the total dis-\ntance is 35 meters.\nM. There are often other clues to work out the distance. \nBy looking at surrounding objects archers can quickly \nget a feeling for distance. For example, if a target, or \n3D deer, is placed down a row of trees, archers can eas-\nily estimate the distance between each tree, normally, \nin a plantation of trees, the gap is usually exactly five \nmeters between each tree, (depending in which part \nof the world or even country) count the gaps and the \narcher will know the distance.\nN.

That is except for the maximum dis-\ntance being shot on the 80 cm face. Here the differ -\nence is 10 metres.\nFor example, for a 40cm target face, the blue peg is be-\ntween 10 and 20 meters while the red one is between 15 \nand 25 meters away from the target. It is therefore impor-\ntant to remember, or to have a note of the distance for \nboth pegs of either colour. By estimating the distance be-"}

Some-\ntimes the two pegs are set side-by-side, so in the above \nexample for a 40 cm target, archers would know that the \ndistance must be between 15 meters (the red minimum) \nand 20 meters (the blue maximum). Very occasionally, \nthe blue is set further then the red so guessing that is a \nlittle tricky.\nO. If the archer is uncertain about the distance and as -\nsumes it may be a little further than it looks; they \nshould go for the ‘percentage shot’ . Set the longer \ndistance and aim the first arrow a little low, say at 6 \no’clock in the 4-ring. With this trick the arrow will \nthen hit into the low 4, the 5 or high 4, depending on \nthe degree of misjudgement. If the archer aims at the 5, \nthey risk a 12 o’clock 4 or 3 and maybe, even worse. Al-\nternatively, the archer could set up the short distance \nand aim high.\nP. If the archer is really uncertain of the distance to the \ntarget, they should definitely go for the ‘mathematic \nshot’ .\nExample: The 60cm target face in the unmarked course \nfor recurve/compound is 20 – 35 metres. T ake half of the \ndifference and add 1 meter: 27 ½ + 1 = 28 ½ meter. This \ngives an indication for the archer’s first arrow. Practice \nmakes perfect and, by continually testing the archer’s own \nestimating ability, they will improve. This will increase \ntheir confidence and performance.\nRange finding with sight\nIf we know the distance from the dominant eye to an aim-\ning object on the bow (e.g. sight ring, scope, arrow rest), \ncalled ‘d’ , and the width of that object ‘a’ , and we know the \nwidth of the target ‘ A’ , and we call the distance to the target \nto be discovered as ‘D’ , then the relationship a / d = A / D \nwill give you the distance to the target by simple calcula-\ntion. This method is based on knowing the size of the tar-\nget face or buttress. Recognizing the target faces of 20 or \n40 cm presents no problem, as the target layout tells you \nthe target size (‘bunny’ or quadruple). But if you mistake \nan 80cm target face for a 60cm target face, or vice versa, it \nwill result in an error in the distance estimation between \n10 and 15 meters. This would result in an error that would \nbe a big loss in the score. It is in this case that the field \nevaluation, and your own experience or intuition should \nhelp; besides of course, studying the various makes of tar-\nget faces in order to see and consider the difference.\nView from side: D is distance to target\n1. Align the pin up a 20cm target face and a 40cm target \nface on the butt.\n2. Measure and mark 20m and 40m from the butt.\n3. Go to the 20m mark with your bow.\n4. By aiming at full draw find something in front of you \nthat covers the 20cm face, for instance the inside or \noutside of the sight ring, the threaded part between \nthe ring and the sight, the bubble on the level, the spot \nor ring on the glass, the with of the arrow, parts on the \narrow rest and so on an so forth.\n5. If you are unable to find something, you have to mod-\nify i.e. change the sight ring or something else which \nwill give the exact measurement of 20cm from 20m"}

(Remember to use only manufacturers’ parts \nand not your own modifications).\n6. Once you have found the correct ring (or whatever) \nsize, go to the 40m mark and measure the 40cm tar -\nget face. If this is correct, and it should be if you have \nbeen accurate enough on the 20cm, you are now able \nto measure any distance provided you know the size of \nthe object you are measuring on – you need to know \nif it is a 20cm, 40cm, 60cm or 80 target face you are \nmeasuring, but you can also use the size of the butt or \nany other object you are familiar with.\nIn practice you proceed as follows. When aiming at full \ndraw you check and see /evaluate how many centimetres \nyou measure on the target face – remember you must \nalways use the same technique, because the distance \nbetween your aiming eye and the part on the bow with \nwhich you use to measure must be the same. The number \nof centimetres that you measure on the target face equals \nthe number of meters, which is the distance from where \nyou stand to the target face you are measuring on.\nIf you stand on an unmarked peg and can measure \n40cm on an 80cm target face – the distance is 40m. On a \n60cm target face the same situation would give you 30m, \nand on a 40cm target face it would be 20m. 40 cm on an \n80cm target face is exact through the middle – the rela-\ntionship is also valid for the other target face sizes.\nIf you measure on an 80cm target face from the edge of \nthe black to the edge of the gold on the opposite side the \ndistance is 48m, as 40+8 = 48cm; with a 60cm target face \nyou get 30+6 = 36cm which gives you 36m If on the other \nhand, you measure from the edge of the black and your \nmeasuring device reaches to the 4 ring on the opposite \nside of the centre, the distance is 40+8+8 = 56cm which \ngives you 56m (in case of an 80cm target face) whereas \non a 60cm target face you would get 42m, as 30+6+6 = \n42cm.\nRemember! This is information you have to learn and \nkeep in your mind, as you are not allowed to carry memo-\nranda on the course. Y ou may, however, have copies of \nparts of the Rules Book with you.\nThe above example shows a sight ring that covers the face \nfrom the edge of the black to ‘a little’ more than the centre \nof the four ring: On an 80cm target face this would cor -\nrespond to approximately 40cm (half of the face) + 8cm \n(half of the gold) + 5cm (plus a ‘little more’ than half of \nthe width of the four ring which is 8cm) = 53cm and con-\nsequently 53m\nOn a 60cm target face it would correspond to 30cm + \n6cm + 4cm = 40cm and thus 40m, which is outside the \nallowed distance for a 60 cm face, which means, this must \nbe an 80 cm face you will be shooting at.\nOn a 40cm target face it would correspond to 20cm + \n4cm + 3cm = 27cm and thus 27m. If you miss by one cm \nor two, you miscalculate the sight setting by one meter or \ntwo, which is still acceptable.\nFor further information and divining field strategies \nyou have a look into: FITA Field Organizers Manual. This \ngives the archer an idea on what they can expect from the \ncourse builders, as mentioned before each course build-\ner has their own signature concerning course building. \nArchers can of course use the same rules and formulas \non animal targets or 3D rounds as long as they know the \ntarget sizes. For the experienced field or 3D archer there \nis no such thing as unmarked distances. That is just for \nthose who don’t take the time necessary to learn how to \ndo it.\nRange Finding for Forest and 3D Animal rounds\nMany rules and formulas of range finding in Field archery \nare also valid for Forest and 3D rounds, if we read ‘animal’ \ninstead of ‘target face’ .

Archers must be able to recognize \nall animal target faces and even those made by the organi-\nzation (which will be announced and shown before the \ntournament starts).\nOnce archers have mastered the ability to hit the vital/\nscoring zone consistently from known distances, it is \nabout time to move on to the next step. Remove all the \ndistance markers and shoot by simply judging the dis -\ntance to the target. The ability to determine distances is \nusually the greatest challenge an archer will face. A wrong \nguess can send the arrow either high or low of the vital/\nscoring zone. Archers can spend a lifetime perfecting this \nability.\nChapter 4.\nUphill and downhill shooting\nA sight mark corresponds to a certain elevation of the \nbow while aiming. In target archery it also corresponds to \na certain distance to shoot. In field archery, when shoot -\ning uphill or downhill, elevation depends not only on the \ndistance to shoot, but also on the difference in altitude \nto overcome. ‘Distance to aim at’ can be different from \n‘distance to shoot’ . The field archer corrects (by adding or \nsubtracting a few metres) according to the slope.\nDistance to shoot + Correction = Distance to aim at\nThe archer has to learn by experience how much to cor -\nrect in different situations. How much distance to sub -\ntract, has to be discovered by each individual archer, it de-\npends on the archer’s equipment and shooting technique. \nDistance correction for slopes is an art in itself, but gener-\nally the distance to aim is less than the distance to shoot \nfor both uphill and downhill shooting. Below are some \npopular corrections for inexperienced field archers:\nSighting for shooting uphill\nAt a slight slope, and especially at long distances, add • \none or two meters to the real distance (dependent of \nthe meter / yardage and the efficiency of the bow).\nAt a very steep slope, deduct at least two meters from • \nthe real distance (dependent of the meter / yardage \nand the efficiency of the bow).\nThe steeper the slope, the more the archer subtracts; how-\never, in uphill shooting above a certain distance, called \nthe ‘jump’ , the rule is ‘the steeper the slope, the less to \nsubtract’ . The distance of this ‘jump’ is dependant on the \nefficiency of the bow.\nSighting for shooting downhill\nAt a slight slope, deduct one, two or three meters from \nthe real distance (dependent of the meter / yardage and \nthe efficiency of the bow)."}

Indoor practice will mainly \nconsist of technical training.\nAlthough all rounds in field archery have a lot in com-\nmon concerning training methods in natural surround-\nings, we do have to be aware of the different disciplines.\nAfter the field archer has mastered the basics of shoot-\ning we start individualizing the key elements of field ar -\nchery such as range finding, in which the coach will find \na lot of challenges. It is the task of the coach to offer the \ntools and the means to use them so that the archers can \ndevelop individually in all aspects of field archery.\nDuring the off season when the weather conditions \nare such that no shooting can take place in the field, in-\ndoor training facilities will be required to practice for the \nnext field season. Depending on the local indoor facilities \nyou have a regular sport complex or a factory hall at your \ndisposal. Use your imagination and improvise to set up \ntargets, always bearing in mind the safety aspects. A target \ncan be placed at higher level or even at ceiling height by \nmeans of a pulley construction. Be sure to secure and pro-\ntect the target at all times. Remember that archers have \nto retrieve their arrows, so make the pulley construction \nreliable and strong.\nPractical training tips for the off-season indoor ses-\nsions\nAs the stance is the basic for body alignment and con-• \nsequently for a good shot, let the archer practice all \npossibilities that we meet when shooting in a natural \nsurrounding.\nAlways start a training session with a warm up. Make • \nthe archer aware of the fact that the warming up proce-\ndure on the field can be interrupted. After the regular \nwarming up and before starting the competition, the \narchers are taken into the field to their target. It may \ntake up to 30 minutes before the competition actually \nstarts so that the archer must also do a small warming \nup at the starting target. During the day it can happen \nthat, while rotating from one target to another, the \narcher has to wait because there is a ‘jam’ which can \nlast half an hour or longer. It is recommended in this \ncase to do a warming up before starting to shoot again. \n(An elastic band in the backpack is recommended).\nLet the archer get the habit of watching the target • \nevery time they start to shoot so that they get a good \nrecognition of the target and learn the importance of \nreading information from the target (Like arrow hits \nleft/right/high/low of gold or kill).\nT o practice shooting on soft ground we use an inner • \ntube from a lorry tyre, filled with air to approximately \nthree quarters and a strong board placed over it in the \nmiddle. Let the archer focus their attention on the tar-\nget which will distract their attention from the stand. \nOpen and closed stances should be practiced.\nPlace a chair with the back facing the target and let • \narchers shoot with one foot on the seat. Observe the \nbody alignment; the standing leg, on which the archer \nputs the bodyweight, should be in a straight line with \nthe body whilst the other leg is ‘resting’ on the chair."}

Or if \npossible, have only light halfway to the target.\nUse original field targets or deer.• \nLet the archers use their field glasses / binoculars after • \neach shot so that they get used to the rhythm in the \nfield to analyse each shot.\nMake them aware that there are only three shots, or • \neven only one, per target and that the next target will \nbe different all together.\nLay a rope Ø0.5 cm on the floor from shooting posi-• \ntion to target and let archers walk along the rope to \npractice walking to and from the target in the field.\nIndoor facilities for instruction\nThe facilities for the off season instructions for field ar -\nchery indoor are the same as described in the FITA Level \n1 manual chapter 11. Watch safety issues; in field archery \nthe shooting line is not always parallel to the target.\nStands or butts for field archery should be made of \nlight material so that they can be easily transported in \nthe field. A lightweight, portable butt is an ideal target for \nfield archery. Butts should be securely fastened.\nFor 3D deer you need different sizes of deer, from the \nvery smallest to the biggest.\nTraining for reliable sight marks\nA reliable table of sight marks is crucial for a field archer. \nThe archers can build up this table during practice. In ad-\ndition the archer learns how much to adjust their sight if \nthey miss the spot by X cm on a certain distance.\nWhen verifying your sight marks on various dis -\ntances, use the opportunity to shoot also a shorter and \na longer distance for each mark. If you are for instance \ncontent with your 20 metres mark, shoot at 17.5 and at 15 \nmetres as well as at 22.5 and 25 metres, using your 20 me-\ntres mark. Note how much you miss the spot on the dif -\nferent distances. Do the same for every 5m interval. Note \nthe deviation at each odd distance. These notes will show \nyou how much you would miss the spot if your sight set -\nting was wrong. Study your figures and note that if your \nsight setting is too long, you will miss the spot less than if \nthe sight setting would be too short. Elite archers use this \nin their advantage, by calculating their aiming a little bit \nhigh in the spot.\nIt is also a fact that poor shots have the tendency of \nhitting low rather than high. So if you trust yourself, your \ntable of marks is based on the upper part of the gold and \nyou stay brave on your marks."}

Make the \narcher aware of the fact that the warming up procedure is \nsomewhat different for target archery (not the exercises, \nas mentioned before on indoor practice) because after \nthe regular warming up and before starting the compe-\ntition, the archers are taken into the field to their target \nwhich may take up to 30 minutes before the competition \nactually starts so that the archer must do a small warm-\ning up at the starting target. It can also happen that dur -\ning the day, while rotating from one target to another, the \narcher has to wait, maybe several times, at a certain target \n(s) because there are more groups waiting for their turn \nto shoot which can last up to 30 minutes or longer then \nit is recommended to do a warming up before starting to \nshoot again. (An elastic band in the backpack is recom-\nmended).\nAdvise and check the archer’s equipment and cloth-\ning, especially the shoe choice.\nBefore starting the practice session walk around the \ntraining course and tell the archers what you want them \nto do on that particular target and point out the safety \naspects of that target and of the whole training field.

In field \narchery the ‘ A’ shooter is the responsible person for that \ngroup.\nT o avoid loss of arrows or damage let the archer first \njudge the distance and then advise the coach at what dis-\ntance they intend to shoot. If the estimation is too long \nyou can correct them.\nLet archers make notes during their practice on what \nthey see through their sight so that they can study the \nsituation afterwards. The distances from the rulebook are \nalso a helpful guide in training. A lot of archers have their \nown ‘bookmarks’ of the distances of each target or deer.\nSunlight will influence archers aiming sideways.

Let archers learn to lean the top of their \nbow more or less into (towards the direction of ) the wind \ndepending on the strength of the wind. This will compen-\nsate for the drift of the arrow similar to adjusting the sight \nsideways, but the archer will not lose their normal centre \nline adjustment.\nShooting across a slope\nWhen shooting at a target across a slope the probability \nof hitting on the downhill side of the face is greater than \nhitting on the uphill side.\nSIRE archery promotion"}

A good backpack is a must for \nfield archery as the archer stays out on the field course \nthe whole day without the opportunity to leave the field \nand fetch something. The archer needs for example up to \n4 litres of drinks, food, spare parts and wet weather cloth-\ning. A small first aid kit and sprays against insects and sun \nprotection. Some archers prefer a belt, besides the quiver, \nto carry their needs during the field tournament but most \narchers prefer a backpack with a seat so that they can sit \ndown during the waiting time at targets.\n \nA good backpack must be waterproof and strong enough \nto sit on, have different compartments, good shoulder \npads / carrying strap. During training sessions let the \narchers carry their backpack and be aware that they carry \nthe backpack on two shoulders. Carrying the backpack \non one shoulder could overburden this shoulder. Let \nthem make a checklist of what to take with them so that \nthe backpack will not become too heavy.\nSpare parts\nDecide which spare equipment to take along on the field \ncourse. This is an individual matter for the archer but as a \ncoach you have to make the archer aware of their choice \nand advice them on this matter. A compound archer will \nmost probably take more spare parts into the field than a \nlongbow or bare bow archer. A spare string or finger tab \nfor example is advisable to take along, so is a knife for \nretrieving stuck arrows from the butt, this would also be \ngood for food matters.\nNutrition\nDecide what kind of food and drinks to take along for a \nwhole day of competition. Should we drink water or a \nsport drink? Nutrition is one of the most important as -\npects for athletes, which has been recognized since the \nfirst competitions in ancient Greece because of the in-\ncreased need for energy. Field archers, involved in heavy \nphysical activity, need more food than target archers. The \nenergy expenditure of an adult amounts to approximately \n2000 – 2800 kcal per day. Physical activity by means of \ntraining or competition will increase the daily expendi-\nture by 500 to 1000 kcal per hour, depending on physi-\ncal fitness, duration, and type of intensity of the activity. \nFor this reason archers must adapt their energy intake by \nincreasing food consumption, according to the level of \ndaily energy expenditure.\nThis increased food intake should be well balanced. \nLarge perspiration losses may pose a risk to health by \ninducing severe dehydration, impaired blood circula-\ntion, and heat dissipation, leading to heat exhaustion \nand collapse.\nFood and meals to be ingested shortly before and \nduring training, or during a small break between train-\ning or competition periods, should be adapted to spe-\ncific ingestion and assimilation conditions, which de-\npend on the nature and circumstances of our sport. \nFood regulations exist for foods covering special needs \nin special circumstances, e.g. dietetic food products. \nHowever, no such regulation is available for sport nu-\ntrition products/ supplements. Also the different food \nhabits all over the world and the different cultures con-\ncerning food have to be taken into consideration. It is \ntherefore the archer that should find the right balance"}

Advisable are the rich in carbohydrate \nbiscuits. Be careful of drinking out of mountain streams \neven if the organizers say there is no danger. Again it is \nup to the archer to see what food and drinks suits them \nbest and the only way to experience that is during an \nintensive training program and competition. During an \nintensive training session ensure that enough water is \navailable.\nIn competition there will be mostly catering points \non the course but as a coach assure your self before the \ncompetition and ask the organizers if there is a possi-\nbility of taking on water in the field.

Its belly is to \nbe of a ‘D’ shape cross-section, the depth is not to be less \nthan 5/8ths of the width. The back must be flat or slightly \nconvex and the sides convex. The handle is about 5 inches \n(125 mm) long in the approximate centre of the bow and \nmay be covered in any material of your choice. The length \nof the bow may not be less than 5 feet when shooting ar -\nrows up to 26 inches long and not less than 5ft. 6 inches \nwhen using arrows longer than 26 inches.\nWhen a bow is made, the bowyer tries to use a well sea-\nsoned wood, even so most bows, but not all, will follow \nthe string to some degree. It means that the wood of the \nbow has taken a set towards its strung position, so that af-\nter the string has been let down and the bow is held hori-\nzontally, belly down, it looks vaguely like a bird in gliding \nflight. If the archer holds too long at full draw the set may \nnot only happen quicker, it will probably cause the bow \nto take a deeper set. A small set taken by a bow may well \nenhance its use, being sweeter to shoot.

My 55lb. self-yew bow went into \na small set during its first year and has not increased too \nmuch in a further eight years of use.\nAmong timbers for bow making Y ew is most univer -\nsally agreed upon as being the best, when made into a \n‘self ’ bow. Such a bow is made with the sapwood left on \nto form the back of the bow, with the darker heartwood \nforming the belly. This arrangement takes advantage of the \nnatural attributes of the wood, which effectively forms a \nnatural laminate, the characteristics of which combine to \nproduce the flexible resistance to bending sought by bow-\nyer and archer. In appearance the self yew bow has a light \nreddish-brown belly with a near-white back, making it a \nmost attractive item. The heartwood of Y ew is also used \nas the belly of the bow with a Hickory back glued in place \nwhich takes the place of the Y ew sapwood. Hickory is a \nhard springy timber used extensively for backing bows. \nBelly woods, apart from Y ew, include Lemon wood, Os-\nage and Beefwood. Although the latter makes a hand-\nsome looking bow it fails to stand up to continuous use \nand is better used in the middle of a triple laminate. Other \nwoods used in this way include Greenheart, Purpleheart \nand Ash, and more recently English yew. A ‘self ’ bow of \nEnglish Y ew rarely makes a long lasting bow, since the an-\nnual rings in the timber are too coarse. Even way back the \nY ew bows used by the armies were nearly always Spanish \nor Italian Y ew. There are lots of other woods which may \nbe used these may be comprehensively listed in other \npublications but not always easily obtainable.\nThe String\nThe string may be made from any material, traditionally \nlinen, hemp and silk were some of the materials used. \nHowever, bearing in mind that a broken string almost \ninvariably means a broken bow, the modern man-made \nalternatives are safer. Having said that, I have seen only \none string break, made of hemp it seemed to break almost \ngently at the top loop and did not cause any damage to \nthe bow. Better safe than sorry, say I, be cautious over \nthe use of some new materials, choose one that does not \nhave a tendency of breaking too readily, the string may \nstill look perfectly good but be aware of unseen stresses \ngoing on within. I have no doubt that a broken string will \nresult in a damaged bow. The new material, Fastflight, is \nalmost guaranteed not to break, looks promising, I have \none bow fitted with it for the past year with no adverse af-\nfects. The best that can be said for it is, that at 180 yards it"}

T rying \nit on one of my older bows gave me the impression that it \ncaused the wood to follow the string more, maybe I was \nlooking too hard for adverse effects. I still think that cau-\ntion is advised when using modern man-made materials.\nAt this point it is only fair to tell you why I prefer the \ndouble loop string to the single loop. First, I have not \nmade it my priority to become proficient in the making of \nthe latter, though I do use one when making new bows, it \nis very handy in the tillering stage where the string length \nhas to be altered several times. Also, if the bow is for my -\nself, during the first dozen or so shots I can make adjust -\nments quite readily to achieve the correct bracing height.\nWhich brings me to the second reason; because of the \nway it is made the loop cannot be protected with a whip-\nping/serving, so any wearing effect on the loop is taken by \nthe string material, which cannot be good for the string or \nfor the bow should the string break.\nThe correct length for a double loop bow string is \nobtained by measuring from the nock to nock along the \nback of the bow and deducting 2 inches from this meas -\nurement. The string, when made, has the allowance for at \nleast the manufacturers recommended number of twists. \nIt is better to have more twists than less – knowledge from \nexperience.\nThe string is adjusted, by twisting, to produce the cor-\nrect bracing height for the bow. For most longbows, this \nwill give a 6 to 7 inch (150 to 175 mm) gap between the \nstring and handle of the bow. T raditionally this is referred \nto as the ‘fistmele’ and is supposed to be measured using \nthe fist with extended thumb, see figure 1 – this could be a \ndubious measurement given the variation in human hand \nsizes.\nFigure 1\nAlthough in my early days of shooting the longbow I did \nhave trouble with the bowyers knot, I soon located the \nreason when I realised that it was in fact nothing more \nthan a straight forward timber hitch, the fault lay in the \nfact that the inner turns must go with the lay of the whip-\nping along the string ending, I’ve never suffered slipping \nsince.\nMaking the Knot\nHang the string from a nail; now take hold of it in the left \nhand at where the knot has to be formed. With the right \nhand, take the bottom end of the string and pass it from \nright to left behind the string, taking the end from the \nleft hand side of the string, leave a smallish loop where \nthe turn has been made, figure 2; now pass the end of the \nstring down through the loop, it is at this point the need \nis to ensure that the free end of the string is going to lie \nin the groove formed by the twisted strands of the string, \nfigure 3; having made sure that it is correct, pick up the \nloose end from the other side of the loop, passing it once \nagain down through the loop, figure 4; a third turn should \nbe made if a heavy poundage bow is used.\nFigure 2\nFigure 3\nDirection of the lay"}

This \nwas overcome by making a short cut down the centre of \nthe end of the shaft parallel to the grain; a thin piece of \nhorn was then glued in. When it is set another shorter \ncut is made, this time across the grain, still in the centre \nthrough both horn and wood.

Sometimes the arrow will recover with a year or \nso of rest but usually the arrow will “take a set” , just as a \nbow may do, and will not be worth shooting. The old time \narchers recognised this fault and footed arrows evolved, \nin which the shaft is fitted with a piece of hardwood for \nthose few vital inches. The hardwood may be Greenheart, \nBeefwood or even Mahogany but its higher density and \nweight necessitates compensation with a lighter pile. See \nfigure 7.\nFigure 7 \nThe number of points of the insert depends on the type of joint \nbeing used. If a ”V” joint is used a two point insert joint will \nresult. If an “X” joint is used a four point insert joint will result.\nSpining of Arrows\nMany manufacturers’ spine their shafts to suit the recurve \nbow. For a longbow it is generally reckoned that spine val-\nues should be about 1/3rd less, but be careful here; as the \nuser of a 26 inch arrow, shot out of a 55lb bow the spine \nrequired is 30/35 group, whereas a friend of mine with a \ndraw length of 28 inches also out of a 55lb bow, uses 40/45 \ngroup. The recommendation is, first settle on the pound-\nage of bow needed, and use it with arrows to the formula \nabove until your draw length becomes consistent. Then \nattempt to fine tune the arrows to the bow.\nShoot several differently spined arrows first, some \nspecialist archery shops used to loan out a set made up \nlike this. When satisfied that the correct group has been \nfound, make up 3 or 4 arrows of that spine or slightly \nstiffer, shoot one of these at a target set at 40 yards/me-\nHardwood footing – two point\nHardwood footing - two point\nHardwood footing - four point\nHardwood footing - four point\nThe arrow\nThis must have a wooden shaft, to which may be fitted a \nbrass or steel pile (point), a nock and with natural feath-\ners as fletchings.\nShafts\nThe shaft may be of any wood but most are unsuitable, \nbeing either, too heavy, too light or too brittle. Arrows \nmade from brittle timber may well break in the bow with \ndisastrous consequences. A fairly light, stringy wood is \nneeded and that known as Port Orford Cedar is used in \nvast quantities. Arrows made from timber recovered from \nold floorboards have achieved a kind of mystical accept -\nance as being ‘the best’; certainly the timber will be well \nseasoned and most probably is of some form of pine.\nSelf-wood arrows are in the vast majority of use, but \nthey do have disadvantages. It seems impossible to find \nstraight shafts and although one may be told “just heat \nthem up and they’ll soften enough to take out any bends”; \nmy experience is that this is often a waste of time that it is \njust not worth it.\nShooting and spectacular results can be obtained with \nwooden arrows which are “chested” i.e. the balance point \nis to the back and sometimes past the centre line of the \narrow. Barrelled arrows can use the same principle of \nkeeping the weight low whilst the spine rating is kept at \na reasonable figure.\nChested arrow.\nBarrelled arrow.\nFletchings\nFletchings are to be of natural feathers. They can be ob -\ntained in various shapes, sizes and colours. There are also \nleft and right wing feathers and never the twain should \nmix! The usual method is 3 feathers at equidistance spac-\ning around the shaft and at a distance from the nock such \nthat the fingers will not touch them during the loose. \nWhen the feathers are secured to the shaft one is at right \nangles to the slot in the nock. This, the “cock feather” , is \noften coloured differently from the other two and always \npoints away from the bow when the arrow is nocked onto \nthe string.

I have \nfound that it is not possible to get some arrows to exactly \nthe same specification; the wood seems to have its own \nideas. It is much easier to have some sort of mechanical \ndevice to spine arrows once you have one with which you \nare completely satisfied. Using such a device, one friend \nof mine measures the depth of bend by rotating the shaft \ninstead of having the grain in each arrow set correctly. I \ncannot say I agree with this method.

This is be-\ncause the dominant eye should be above the arrow nock \nwhen at full draw, it is necessary to find out in which hand \nthe bow should be held. Here is a simple and quick way \nto find out:\nWith both eyes open, point with one finger at a small \nor distant object, then close the left eye and check if the \nfinger is pointing directly at the object looking with the \nright eye. If it is, the right eye is dominant, if it is not, the \nleft eye is dominant. As further proof, open the left eye \nand close the right eye, if your finger appears to point to \nthe right of the object the right eye is dominant, if the fin-\nger stays pointing at the object the left eye is dominant.\nWith a right handed archer the bow is usually held in \nthe left hand, it feels natural in the sense that the left arm \nwould be held out steady, whilst the right hand draws the \nback the string. So normally we have –\nRight eye dominant – hold the bow in the left hand.\nLeft eye dominant – hold the bow in the right hand.\nWe often find people who are right eye dominant but are \nnaturally left handed (or vice versa). For these people, at \nfirst, try what comes naturally. That should be, I imagine, \nthe bow being held in the “non-preferred hand” (i.e. a \nnormally right handed person will hold the bow in their \nleft hand) using the dominant hand to draw and loose the \nstring. If then the target is missed because the dominant \neye takes over, one of two things can be done – a) wear a \npatch over the dominant eye whilst shooting, or b) change \nover handiness and learn to shoot the other way round. \nMany people in fact have learned to shoot, what feels to \nthem, the wrong way round. There are many archer’s who \nshoot with both eyes open, whilst this is desirable some \nfind it difficult to do. Some archers come to full draw then \njust half close the eye not used for aiming just to be sure \nthe correct eye is the one doing the aiming.\n2) Arrow length\nThere are many ways to determine an arrow length for the \nlongbow archer; explained below are two such methods.\na) This is established, at first, by holding an arrow with \nits nock end against the top of the breast bone and the \nother end of the shaft between the palms of the hands, \nstretched horizontally forward. An arrow which reach-\nes a couple of inches (50 mm) beyond the finger tips \nof the outstretched hands should be a safe length to \ndraw to the chin for a beginner. See figure 8.\nFigure 8"}

Have the archer fit the \narrow to the bow then draw the bow to their comfort-\nable full draw position. A colleague can read off the ar-\nrow the measurement that comes to the far side of the \nbow; then add at least two inches (50 mm) to allow for \na safety margin, this measurement can then be used to \nchoose arrows of a suitable length. See figure 9.\nFigure 9\n3) Preparation.\nA bracer is worn on the bow arm and does in fact brace \nthe clothing out of the way of the string. But, when shoot-\ning a longbow its other purpose is to protect the forearm \nfrom the lash of the string after the act of “loosing” . This is \nmost important when the archer is a beginner, if the bow \narm is not rotated correctly, to give clearance; there is a \nchance that during the string travel it will slap the bow \narm. The bracer can be home made using a plain piece of \nleather, or may be a purchased plastic or composite ma-\nterial type, or may even be leather reinforced with metal \nrods; it is secured by buckles, laces or some similar meth-\nod. The bracer can be seen in figure 11.\nA tab is worn on the string hand, a double thickness \nof leather is recommended, at least in the early days of \nshooting. The tab covers the three fingers used to pull \nthe string. A tab can be obtained that has a non-pinching \nblock fitted between the forefinger and the middle finger. \nThere are also shooting gloves available – these usually \ncover the three fingers used to draw the string and is at -\ntached to the wrist via small straps, but some are now \navailable where all the hand is covered but have leather \nreinforcing over the first three fingers. See figure 10.\nFigure 10\nSince no mechanical arrow rest is permitted, the arrow \nmust rest on the upper edge of the bow hand. This means \nthat the point at which the arrow is nocked onto the \nstring becomes both very important and very personal, \nas too high a nocking point will cause the arrow to come \nout of the bow erratically, while a low nocking point will \nresult in a cut or grazed hand as the feather fletchings drag \nacross it during the initial moments of arrow flight. I do \nnot advocate the use of wearing a glove on the bow hand \nas one tends to lose the “feel” of shooting.\nHolding the Bow\nTake hold of the bow in the hand determined by the \ndominant eye, with the arm hanging loose by your side \nthe bow should be horizontal to the ground with the \nstring crossing the forearm. The grip should be firm but \nnot clenched. The wrist should be straight, or nearly so. \nNow lift the bow up vertically in front of you. T ake care-\nful note where the handle sits in the hand and check that \nthe bow is the right way up (the arrow plate and, usually, \nthe larger horn nock are on the upper limb). The bow \nshould sit somewhere near the ball of the thumb. This \nmay feel strange but the wrist must not be “inside” the \nbow during the “loose” because, should the string hit \nthe bracer with the arrow still nocked on, the chances \nof knowing where the arrow may go is rather slim and \nit may take some time locating it if it missed the target. \nSee figures 11 & 12."}

This is because, generally, \na heavier draw weight is required when shooting a long-\nbow, than in other types of bow, to give a reasonable ar -\nrow flight. See figure 13.\nOfficially the “Mediterranean” grip on the string (one \nfinger above the nock and two below) is the only one \nused in longbow shooting. I have seen two finger hold-\ning and loosing but would not recommend it because of \nthe heavier poundage, as mentioned above, resulting in a \ngreater strain on the fingers which may cause an injury.\nFigure 13\nPoint of Aim (P .O.A.). In order to shoot at a target with \nsome consistency of hitting it we need several things. Eve-\nryone would like to be able to aim at the gold but this \nis rarely possible and some degree of “aiming off ” must \nbe employed. One alternative is to aim at a point on the \nedge of the butt or on a leg of the stand, or even, at some \ndistances, a prominent branch of a tree, a bunch of leaves \nor some other feature that is in line with your shot. The \n“mark on the bow” M.O.B. is accurately located on this \nat the moment of loose. Remember, a longbow is not a \n“centre shot” bow! This is vividly demonstrated when, \nhaving an arrow nocked on the string and the bow hand \naimed at the target, the arrow will be seen to point wide \nof the mark, perhaps even at the target beside the one \nyou wish to hit. Many archers try to spine their arrows \nto enable them to put their M.O.B. on the gold, to hit it \nthe arrow must go round the bow. Others use a very thick \n Figure 11 Figure 12\nNote that the top of the hand is level with the top of the \nhandle. It is essential to keep this constant if consistency \nof the aiming point is to be maintained.\nMark on the Bow\nA “mark on the bow” (MOB) is allowed for aiming pur -\npose and this may be a natural mark in the wood, handle \nof the bow or simply the knuckles of the bow hand. A \nrubber band (an ”O” ring or similar) is the simplest aim-\ning “mark” , as it can be rolled up or down the bow limb \nto suit the distance being shot. Many archers use the pile \nof the arrow to aim with but this can cause problems at \nshort and long distances. All bows will be “pile on” at one \ndistance, light poundage bows will be “pile on” at short \ndistances but making it difficult at longer distances, with \nthe heavier bows may be “pile on” at longer distances but \nmaking it difficult at shorter distances. The mid-range \npoundage bows will have problems on both the very \nshort distances and long distances alike. The following \ndescribes a way I have heard of overcoming the problem \n– the archer has three different poundage bows, the most \npowerful for the 100 yards and the lower poundage bows \nfor the 80 yards and 60 yards. Of course three different \nsets of arrows are required, as different weight bows need \ndifferently spined arrows. There are several ways of over -\ncoming this problem but I prefer the rubber band, which \nis an aid to shooting, especially repetitively at longer dis -\ntances, though there are “traditionalists” that frown on its \nuse. If you are used to shooting with a rubber band and \nthen take it off for some reason it may take a few ends to \nfind a good aiming point, but once one has been found it \nis very satisfying to shoot this way.\nThe Hold on the String\nThe forefinger is placed on the string above the nock, the \nmiddle and ring fingers beneath, with a clear gap between \nthe fingers and the nock. Many beginners are taught to \nhave the gap below the nock but I found that, in my own"}

Thick rubber bands are frowned \nupon, generally accepted is that any rubber band being \nused cannot be thicker than 1/8th of an inch (3 mm). A \nfew archers, who aim with the pile of the arrow, cant/lean \nthe top of the bow away from the arrow, which again has \nthe effect of aiming at the gold. Correctly spined arrows \nshould always be used. Be very careful if the decision is to \ncant/lean the bow, for the angle must be as precise as pos-\nsible for every shot. It may take many years of practice to \nachieve the effect consistently. A correctly spined arrow \nshould, with the aid of the “archer’s paradox” just clear \nthe bow after being loosed.\nThe Archers’ Paradox\nAt the loose all the stored energy of the bow is applied to \nthe nock end of the arrow via the string and, due to the \ninertia of the pile, the shaft of the arrow bends, initially \ninwards toward the bow. As the arrow starts to move for-\nward, the shaft recovers through straightness and bends \nthe other way, reaching a maximum bend as the fletch-\nings slide past the bow. The bending effect dies out quite \nquickly and a correctly spined arrow will fly straight. It \nmay well “kiss” the bow as it passes, but will have little \neffect on its flight.\nThe Loose Point\nIn recurve bow shooting “the loose point” is known as \nthe anchor point but in general terms longbow archers do \nnot hold for long enough to call it an anchor point. In tar-\nget shooting the generally accepted point of loose is from \nunder the chin/jawbone. One way is to bring the upper \nfinger under the chin/jawbone, still drawing back until \nthe string touches the chin and nose simultaneously, then \nimmediately or with minimum hold, straighten/relax the \nfingers allowing the string to pull off the fingers. Do not \ntry to unhook the fingers from the string. See figures 14 \nand 15.\nFigure 14\nFigure 15"}
{"id": "Coaching_Manual_Level2-0140", "source": "Coaching_Manual_Level2.pdf", "chunk_index": 139, "page_start": 153, "page_end": 153, "text": "Longbow 11\nAnother way, again the upper finger comes under the \nchin/jawbone, this time the string is brought to the side \nof the chin/jawbone and loosed as before. A “kisser” on \nthe string is allowed as long as it is not used as a sight -\ning aid and must not be in line with the eye and target. A \n“kisser” is a special sort of button fitted around the string \ntight enough not to slip about and is used at longer dis -\ntances. Its position on the string is found by experimen-\ntation. During shooting the hand is brought back a few \ninches or more below the chin/jawbone and the kisser is \npositioned between the lips before the loose. Be careful \nhere, injuries may result if the “kisser” is not fitted cor -\nrectly. By using this method a “pile on” or point of aim \n(P .O.A.) near the target is possible at least, at 100 yards. \nY et another “loose” position is with the tip of the index \nfinger touching the corner of the mouth. This, combined \nwith a canted/leaning bow is used extensively in Field \nShooting and is really only for shorter distances, possibly \nup to 60 yards with a moderately powerful bow. A bow \nlike a tree trunk would be needed to shoot 100 yards with \nthis particular style.\nMaking the Shot\nWith bow in hand and arrows in the quiver, the archer \nstands astride the shooting line, feet comfortably apart, \nbow-arm shoulder presented to the target. The bow is \nnow brought round to the front of the body, held at a \ncomfortable angle to enable an arrow to be “nocked” \nonto the string.\nNocking on: take an arrow about two inches (50 mm) \nbelow the fletchings, bring it up and over the bow, rest -\ning it on the uppermost finger of the bow-hand and firmly \nnock it onto the string at the nocking point. This point is \napproximately 1/8th to ¼ of an inch (3 to 6 mm) above a \nright angle from the string to the top of the finger the ar -\nrow is resting on. The cock feather must be pointing away \nfrom the bow at a right angle. Now the fingers are care-\nfully hooked onto the string – remember, it’s one finger \nabove, two fingers below the arrow nock and the fingers \nnot touching the nock of the arrow. See figure 16.\nFigure 16\nStill standing comfortably, head upright and looking \nstraight ahead, the bow arm is moved back to the side, \nbow vertical. Now, if the shot is not going to be made with \nboth eyes open close the non aiming eye and turn the head \ntoward the target. Locate and concentrate on the selected \npoint of aim (P .O.A.). With the bow arm straight (extend-\ned) but not locked at the elbow, draw back the string stead-\nily. The bow-arm does two things, resisting the pressures \nfrom the string and raising the bow toward the point of \naim (P .O.A.), all these actions are simultaneous. When the \npoint of aim (P .O.A.) and the mark on the bow (M.O.B.) \nare together there should be about 1 inch (25 mm) to go \nto the loose point. Keep the drawing of the string going, \nas soon as the string touches the chin and nose, and with \nminimal hold relax the fingers, the kinetic energy built up \nin the wood of the bow will pull the string off the fingers; \nthe drawing hand, with the weight relieved will fly back at \nleast to the neck under the ear. The bow-arm is held still \npointing toward the point of aim (P .O.A.) until the arrow \nis flying toward the target. See Figures 17 and 18.\nFigure 17"}

There are rules which must be observed. When \nshooting in the company of other archers, all must wait \nuntil everyone has shot all their arrows, those finishing \nfirst must step back from the shooting line. It is courtesy \nwhen shooting with a companion, to stay on the line until \nboth have finished shooting and then step back together. \nUsually at organised shoots a field captain will give the \nsignal to advance to the targets to score and retrieve the \narrows. In practice shooting it is by mutual agreement, \nunless one person has been nominated, who is answer -\nable for all deviations from safety. When moving up the \ncourse, everyone must walk – do not run; and be keeping \na lookout for arrows that have fallen short. It is the custom \nin archery that if an arrow is damaged or broken by some \naccident, the perpetrator is expected to offer to pay for \nit. On arrival at the target the scorer proceeds to record \nthe scores, when nominated each archer calls out their \nscoring arrows in turn. The arrows are called in batches of \nthree and in descending order – i.e. 9, 7, 5, the archer will \npause and the scorer calls them back as the sores are re-\ncorded, if there are more arrows to record the archer calls \ntheir value – i.e. 5, 1, miss, the archer will pause again and \nthe scorer will call them back as they are recorded. Note \nthat arrows that have missed the target must be called and \nrecorded. No arrows can be removed from the target until \nall arrows have been scored and recorded on the official \nscore cards. Also, any arrows that have missed the target \nshould not be retrieved until the scoring routine has been \ncompleted for all the archers and that target.\nT o withdraw an arrow from the target: If standing on \nthe left side facing the butt, the back of the left hand is \nplaced close to the arrow which is to be withdrawn, the \nright hand then holds the arrow close to the target as pos-\nsible, and in one smooth movement the arrow is removed \nfrom the target. Do not twist or wiggle the arrow about \nwhile pulling it free, it causes stress to the wood fibres, \nweakening them. There is another point to watch out for \nwhen taking hold of the arrow shaft, the emphasis must \nbe on the fingers, if the heel of the hand is pressed against \nthe wood, sometimes an alarming bend is caused to ap -\npear in the shaft, with arrows that are not very old this \ndoes not seem to do any harm. When it is one of your \narrows being withdrawn, with your permission, of course, \nthe bend can look very alarming. The reason why the back \nof the hand is placed on the target face, it has turned into \na handy receptacle to hold the withdrawn arrows. Also, \nanother courtesy is extended here, if a fellow archer can-\nnot find an arrow that missed the target then everyone on \nthat target joins in the search.\nWhen returning to the shooting line after retrieving \nthe arrows “no one takes up position on the line” until \nall archers are back behind it, then and only then, will the \nField Captain or nominated person give the signal to re-\ncommence shooting.\nTo Hold, or Not to Hold\nHolding a longbow at full draw is detrimental to the \nbow. There is an old saying “when a bow is fully drawn \nit is nine-tenths broke” . When a bow is being “weighed” \nthat is, calibrated to find the poundage at the draw length \nspecified, if that bow is held at its maximum recommend-\ned draw length, the poundage reading drops quite quickly \nduring the first one and a half seconds, then the loss less -\nens to where at about two or three seconds further loss is \nhardly noticeable. The loss varies according to the initial \npoundage, more with a “heavy” bow, less with the “light -\ner” bows. There are many good longbow archers who ex-\nploit this phenomenon and hold long enough for the first \nrapid loss to slow, meanwhile holding the point of aim \n(P .O.A.) and, when ready “loose” . I should think the loss \nmay be two or three pounds with a 60lb. bow to about \none pound on a 35 lb. bow. This is just estimation; I have \nno real means of checking as different woods respond dif-\nferently to differing draw weights and draw lengths. What \nI do know is, when the wood is young (a bow is made \nfrom seasoned wood, so lets say “young” in the sense of \na newly made bow) the wood recovers quite quickly but \nan archer who holds at full draw must expect the average \nbow to quickly follow the string and, from then on, lose \npower. This is hardly noticeable at first but two or three \nyears of fairly regular use will show its effects. Some arch-\ners who hold, and maybe a few who do not, unstring the \nbow between ends in an effort to delay the wearing effect"}

I have no idea of the effect this continual stringing \nand unstringing routine has on the wood of the bow but \nI have heard it said it is as detrimental as is holding at full \ndraw. If it is that bad, why hold at all? The most obvious \nreason is it enables the point of aim (P .O.A.) to be locat-\ned accurately and held steady before the loose. Another \nfactor is the string can be controlled. Also, the body may \nbe composed; that is if an archer can be composed at all \nwhen holding a heavy bow at full draw. It is your choice. \nLongbows are no longer cheap or as plentiful as they used \nto be. Self-yew bows are becoming rare and expensive.\nMethods of coming to the Loose\nFluid flow draw\nThis is a method of shooting in which the bow is brought \nfrom a position just below the point of aim (P .O.A.), \nup to the point of aim and to full draw and loose in one \nsmooth movement. This I believe is the most efficient \nmethod of shooting. When mastered, it enables a heavier \nbow to be used, which gives a lot more authority to the \narrow flight.\nThe “T” Draw:\nWith this type of draw the bow is held with the arm up \nand forward, with the Mark on the bow (M.O.B.) and \npoint of aim (P .O.A.) held in line and the drawing arm up \nready. The string is then pulled back steadily to the loose \npoint, where the fingers are relaxed/straightened and the \nhand and arm carry on backward, all completed in one \nsmooth movement called the “follow-through” .\nThere may be some variations on both methods. Both \nare used with the hold type of shooting. Most “holders” \ndo so for about two and a half seconds, never more than \nthree seconds. Whatever method is chosen it must be \npracticed to perfection. It is no good picking up a long-\nbow once a week and expecting to become proficient. An-\nyone who says they have only shot their bow once since \nthe year before then goes on to win is, in all probability, \nbending the truth, or playing at gamesmanship with ap -\nplying psychology.\nPractice at short distances at first – 15 yards/metres is \nabout right – then, when feeling happy about your im-\nproving skill, move the target further back by about 10 \nyards/metres. After that try shooting 40 yards/metres, \nyour first “real” distance. Later you can try a few arrows \nat 60 yards/metres, or 80 yards/70 metres, or even 100 \nyards/90 metres, just to get the idea of what it feels like \nto shoot at longer distances or just to see if the bow will \npropel arrows that far. Even when you feel you are profi-\ncient, it helps many aspects of your shooting to practice \nat shorter distances, say 40 or 50 yards/metres. This can \nboost your confidence, polish your technique and help \nyou sort out your best arrows.\nChange of Distance\nThis can be the most difficult technique to master. Unlike \nusing a modern Recurve bow, where in the vast major -\nity of cases the bow is held long enough to assume “unit \naiming position” , then still held long enough to steady \nthe sight on the gold. If a longbow were to be held, if at \nall possible, then one or two disastrous things could hap-\npen. Either the archer would be left with just the handle \nin their hand, with the rest of the bow at the feet, or, at the \nloose the arrow would just creep out of the bow and flop \nsomewhere between the shooting line and the target.\nUnit aiming, which mentioned above, requires a little \nexplaining. The bow is held with the bow arm at a right \nangle to the body, using the “T” draw method, the bow \nis then fully drawn to the loose point and held. The body \nthought of as a little “t” , is then pivoted at the hips back -\nward away from the target, until the mark on the bow \n(M.O.B.) /sighting point is on your aiming mark i.e. the \ngold, then steadied before loosing. The first part of the flu-\nid flow method, that of drawing the bow, can also be used, \nbecause it still looks good, that a little heavier poundage \nbow may be used. See figure 19."}

Most longbow archers raise the bow-arm to \ngive the arrow a high enough trajectory to reach the tar -\nget. Unfortunately, when raising the bow-arm and leaving \nthe rest of the body the same, the draw-length shortens \n– just a little – which in turn reduces the poundage and \nlength of power-stroke and, therefore reduces the impart-\ned power into the arrow. But do not despair, all that has \nto be done is to elevate the bow-arm a small amount to \ncompensate. That is ok for 80 yards for men and 50 yards \nfor ladies, but what happens at 100 yards for men and 60 \nyards for ladies? The only answer really is to change to a \nmore powerful bow, or a bow with a better cast. There is \none method that may help, that is the fluid flow method \nof shooting. I found that this method seemed automati-\ncally to set my body into the correct stance, without the \nneed to hold at all at the point of loose.\nThere is not a great deal of advice to give but to warn \nof possible reasons for poor results. Y ou have to think \nabout it. Poor performance is more often than not due to \na faulty technique.\nCast of the bow, this depends in the first instant on \nthe recovery of the woods, its elasticity being the reason \nit was selected in the first place. The job of the bow is to \npropel the arrow away from itself, the faster it recovers \nthe more speed is imparted to the arrow and the greater \nthe cast. A short bow will naturally recover faster than a \nlonger one and consequently shorter bows tend to have a \nbetter cast but, in any case, in long-bow target archery a \nbow shorter that 5 feet is not allowed.\nChapter 3 Shooting Styles\nClout Shooting\nOriginally the “Clout” was a small piece of cloth placed \non a short stick and stuck into the ground, and was for \ntraining archers to shoot accurately over long distances. \nIn modern times a similar piece of cloth is attached to a \nsmall stick, like a flag, and placed in the centre of a large \nroundel target marked out on the ground to allow for \nscoring the landed arrow value. The distance for shooting \nthe modern “Clout” is 180 yards for gentlemen and 120 \nyards for ladies. The British Long-bow Society rules say \nthat the centre is a small straw butt, a hit on which counts \nfor a “6” . There is also a series of rings marked out on the \nground, scoring from the inner to the outer 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 re-\nspectively, with a total outer diameter of 24 feet. It sounds \nbig until you try to hit it from 180 yards. In some respects \nit is an extension of target archery.\nHere it is essential to have a mark on the bow (M.O.B.) \nwhich, with even a powerful bow, has to be below the \nhandle. The other thing is of course, bearing in mind that \na long-bow is not a centre-shot bow (and assuming no \nwind) the point of aim (P .O.A.) may well be to one side \nof the Clout. In target shooting, when changing to longer \ndistances, a body-lean backward, or an extra elevation \nof the bow was needed, to give the flying arrow height \nenough to carry to the target. The “T” draw method may \nbe used, and some archers using it are quite successful. \nWhat usually happens is, with the arm elevated and with \na loose point on the front of the chin, it becomes almost \nimpossible to see the Mark on the bow (M.O.B.), the \nfirst change can be to move the loose point to the side \nof the chin. If the mark on the bow (M.O.B.) still can-\nnot be located then move the loose point to the corner \nof the mouth, indexing it with the tip of the forefinger. \nI would not advocate a higher position on the face, be-\ncause naturally when the loose point is higher, the bow \narm must be elevated further to compensate. Having \nmentioned a “kisser button” before, it is possible, if the \nbutton is moved up the string allowing the drawing hand \nto be lowered down toward the chest, that a mark on the \nbow (M.O.B.) above the handle could be used. Remem-\nber the English bowmen in history where the bow was \ndrawn to the “pap” . Unfortunately, as this involves an in-"}

So, all things considered, a loose point on \nthe chest is not a good style for Clout or target shooting.\nThe fluid flow method is the one to use and I am con-\nvinced there is not a better method, its biggest advantage \nbeing that a heavier bow can be used. The loose point can \nbe by the corner of the mouth, or to the side or under the \nchin. The stance on the line and usual sequence of move-\nments in nocking an arrow and setting the body is similar \nto that for target shooting, except that the large “aiming \noff ” needed at these extreme distances means that the \npoint of aim (P .O.A.) should be regarded as the “target” \nfor the purpose of “setting the body” .\nWhen the draw is started, the bow arm will for a mo -\nment obscure the point of aim (P .O.A.), and it is neces -\nsary to have in your mind’s eye a picture of the complete \ndraw action. The bow arm swings up and the body is \nlaid back from the hips see figure 20, or, as I often have \nto do, by bending the rear leg, see figure 21. Following \nthe reappearance of the point of aim (P .O.A.), merging \nof the point of aim (P .O.A.) with the mark on the bow \n(M.O.B.). Reaching the loose point a really fast straight -\nening/relaxing of the fingers, must take place as a smooth \ncontinuous movement. The follow-through of the draw -\ning hand should be natural and the finish position held \nfor 1 or 2 seconds.\nFigure 20\nFigure 21\nA little bit of analysis of the above would not come amiss. \nThe stance on the line, that’s OK, as usual. The turning of \nthe body away from the actual Clout toward the point of \naim (P .O.A.), is funnily enough one of the hardest things \nto do, as it seems natural to have the shoulder pointing at \nwhere the arrow is expected to land. But the distances in-\nvolved in Clout shooting considerably magnify the effects \nof small changes of body angle. It is essential to set up the \nbody for the shot as though the point of aim (P .O.A.) were \nthe Clout, since taking a stance as if aiming directly at the \nClout will demand a marked compensatory movement \nto the point of aim (P .O.A.) and a consequent change of \nposture. Such a change will inevitably affect the shooting \nmethod, which by now, hopefully, is instinctive. Y ou may \nthink that this is being over cautious; you only need to \nhave a small muscle twitch, at the moment of loose, when \nshooting at even short distances and see where the arrow \nlands, and compare this to your average grouping.\nThe lifting up of the bow-arm, drawing of the string \nand the lay back does not really need any elaborating \nbut the temporary distraction of losing the point of aim \n(P .O.A.) may be a bit of a problem. Here also the position \nof the head becomes very important. The head must stay \nperpendicular to the body, as at the stance, with the eye \ncompensating for the change of angle. The archer must"}

I have ex -\nperimented on several occasions, in competitive shoots \nand came to the conclusion that, although in my case a \nsteadier sort of loose was required at target shooting, at \nthe Clout a faster loose, just short of a “snatched” one, \ngave better results. The follow-through is quite important. \nThe slightest hint of a forward loose or attempting to “un-\nhook” the fingers will result in an arrow landing short of \nthe scoring area. Having got all that right the only worry \nnow is the wind!\nCross winds are a little easier to deal with than a wind \nblowing up or down the course. If the cross wind is com-\ning in such a way that your arrows are landing left of the \nexpected location, then the point of aim (P .O.A.) should \nbe located further to the right, with the consequent stance \nalteration, or vice versa should the wind come from the \nopposite direction.\nHead winds are a little more difficult to deal with. Be-\ncause the British Long-bow Society rules are that Clout \nshould be shot two-way, when shooting in one direction \nthe wind may be head on, and when shooting back down \nthe course the wind will be from behind. When the wind \nis “head on” the tendency, because the arrows are dropping \nshort, is to elevate the bow more and more; but the longer \nthe arrow is in the air the more time the wind has to push it \nabout. Also, if a bow has been elevated above 45 degree, the \narrow will drop short even on a calm day. I try to sharpen \nmy technique and induce more power from the bow. With \nwinds from behind, the natural reaction is to correct, lower \nthe elevation to reduce the chance of overshooting.\nIf you are unfortunate enough to find yourself at a \nshoot with a weak bow, with the wind coming “head on” \nand the arrows are not reaching do one of two things; \npractice improving your shooting technique or experi-\nment with it; alternatively try various ways of shooting to \nsee how far up the course you can get your arrows. Most \nof all enjoy the outing. Still with the weaker bow and the \nwind from behind, you may well find you do not need to \nelevate the bow-arm as high as the norm, as arrows with \nthe wind behind will carry further.\nField Shooting\nThe shooting of arrows from the bow is basically the \nsame, although the small differences which do exist are \nimportant. In fact there are a few archers, who shoot both \ntarget and field archery using their target technique, and \nsome are quite successful.\nBoth fluid flow and “T” draw styles are used. In the fluid \ndraw method I found that it was best to keep the bow verti-\ncal, as trying to adopt the same angle when canting/leaning \nthe bow for each shot, is more than a little difficult! Prob-\nably I need more practice! My loose point is at the corner \nof the mouth using my forefinger as the reference indica-\ntor. I did experiment with different styles but in all of them, \nbecause the rules specify no mark on the bow (M.O.B.), I \nused the “gap-shooting” method at all distances.\nGap Shooting\nEvery archer will find that there is one distance at which \nthey can aim at and hit the target by lining up the pile of \nthe arrow with the centre plus offset of the target. This will \nvary according to the weight of the bow and the style of \nshooting used but is usually to be found between 20 yards/\nmetres and 50 yards/metres. As one gets nearer the target \nfrom this point, a gap must be estimated to give a point of \naim (P .O.A.) below the target centre, increasing in size as \nthe target is approached. Be aware however, the gap needs \nto start reducing again at a distance about 12 to 15 yards/\nmetres. With the distance further from the target than \n“pile-on” means allowing for a gap above the target. In the \nhold method the gap is worked out at full draw but in the \ninstant loose method the gap must be calculated before or \nduring the draw. Both may be effective. Practice and more \npractice is required. The canted/leaning bow is used in \nboth styles and, of course, the arguments as which is the \n“best” style will not stop, nor really be resolved. Y ou must \njust try the different methods and styles to find one that \nfeels right for you. I feel sorry for people who are taught \none particular style and stick to it, to no avail, frustrated \nbeyond endurance, they drop out of the sport altogether.\nRovers\nThis form of shooting was much favoured in the days when \narchery was the sport to indulge in. It is often seen as a \nform of Clout shooting but is, in fact, “Shooting to a Mark” . \nIn the traditional version of “Shooting at Rovers” a group \nof archers would wander over open land, shooting at natu-\nral “marks” , with the next target being chosen by the archer \nwhose arrow fell nearest to the “mark” that was being shot. \nNow, as a result of limitations on open space, it is more \ncommon to shoot at “marks” set up by the shoot organizers \nwhich is still very enjoyable and very rewarding."}

The archer relies on the coach and this implies a spe-\ncial responsibility from the coach’s side. It is the coach’s \njob amongst others to free the athlete from all organiza-\ntional work that has nothing to do with the primary task \nof shooting arrows.\n2. Data banking\nThere is a lot of ‘data’ that a coach has to record and, at the \nappropriate time, to retrieve. For each athlete the person-\nal data, as well as the archery results, has to be recorded. \nAlso details of shooting technique and physical prepared-\nness are of interest for use in the future. For a success -\nful cooperation between archer and coach over a longer \nperiod of time, planning is needed. It is an important task \nfor the coach to make long term and short term planning \nand to have evaluations at appropriate moments.\nFor each training session the coach works out in ad-\nvance a plan on paper in detail for the activities they want \nto guide. During the training session the inexperienced \ncoach can consult the plan in order to guide a logical and \nsmooth session. After the training session the coach es -\ntablishes that they have worked in conformity with the \nplanning or otherwise changes the plan for the next year.\nEach coach can draw a ‘contract’ with their archer, \nstating the objectives for that archer. The archer signs \ntheir contract together with the coach and the coach \nkeeps the contract filed. Evaluation of goals is not too dif-\nficult then.\nEach archer has to do with data banking too. Tun-\ning parameters such as bracing (or string) height, sight \nmarks and so on have to be written down in the archer’s \nnotebook. It is also of importance for the archer to record \ntheir objectives in the long term as well as a goal for each \ncompetition. Archers should on a daily or weekly basis \nkeep track in their notebook of activities and goals, goal \nachievement, strategies and goal progress. The archer’s \nnotebook should be kept in the bow case as a part of the \n‘equipment’ .\n3. Variability\nA person can accomplish the shooting task in many dif -\nferent ways, using different sets of components of the \nmuscle system. Although not every execution will look \nand feel like an efficient and beautiful one, the result can \nstill be an inner ten! For the result of a single shot in ar -\nchery the forces that work on the arrow on release are im-\nportant, the way in which the archer uses the muscles is \nnot uniquely determined. For the human skeleton there \nis an ideal stance. The archer tries to fix this stance of the \nbones by means of their muscles. In reality, even with-\nout any windy conditions, ‘fixation’ of the body is in fact \nmaintaining equilibrium around this desired position.\n4. Motivation\nMotivation, or the will to perform and to abandon activi-\nties that do not lead to the desired goal, is necessary for \nan athlete to fulfil the long route to the highest platform. \nT o become a champion apart from talent and hard work \nmotivation is absolutely necessary. In competition moti-\nvation is sometimes called the ‘killer instinct’ .\nArchers have their own motivation: they do it for fun, \nfor their own sake, for their satisfaction, for sheer enjoy -\nment. This is called intrinsic motivation; it is part of the \nathlete‘s personal character.\nExtrinsic motivation comes from the archer‘s environ-\nment: financial awards, trips to distant countries, status, \nmedals, and so on. Even a very small amount of money \nto win can be an extrinsic motivation for a recreational \narcher. The presence of spectators (social facilitation) is \nanother example of extrinsic motivation.\nDuring a training session, when instructing, the coach \nmust motivate the archers for each exercise to raise alert-\nness and to increase enjoyment. They can use external \nmotivation of the athletes by promising an award for the \nwinner like a free drink.\n5. Self-confidence\nMost important for (intrinsic) motivation is self-con-\nfidence; which is a mental property. The athlete must \nregularly experience success in order to develop self-\nconfidence. In archery, on level 1, the coach manipulates \nthe experience of success by organising shooting at a \nshort distance and by using a big target face. On level 2 \nthe archers themselves can regain self-confidence after \nsome bad scores during a training session by shooting a \nfew ends (on a bare butt) at a short distance, so that the \narrows group much closer together.\nIt is of great help for the archer‘s self-confidence when \nthe coach encourages the archer by giving positive feedback. \nExamples of positive feedback are: “Well done! ” “Good! ” \nor similar. As a coach try, in a practice situation, not to tell \nthe athlete what they are doing wrong. On the contrary, \nmake some comment about what is done very well and find \na task to repeat the exercise with less change for errors."}

Goal setting\nThe way to a high performance level is a long one, moti-\nvation from archer and coach and a lot of (hard) work is \nnecessary. Goals can help to go through this long route; \nthey motivate and improve athletic performance.\nThere are different types of goals; they can be achieved \nor missed. Missing a realistic goal is part of the sport. The \ncoach must encourage the athletes to set goals. It is a com-\nmon mistake for inexperienced archers setting too many \nand non-effective goals.\nGood goals meet a lot of properties. The acronym \nSMART (ER) is a reminder for some of them. The mean-\ning of SMARTER is Specific, Measurable, Action-orient-\ned, Realistic, Time-phased, Exigent and Recorded.\nS• pecific means that the goal is not too general. Goals \nlike ‘I will do my best’ are not specific; they are too \ngeneral and therefore not very effective.\nM• easurable means that the outcome, i.e. the goal \nachievement, can be measured in the sense that it \ncan be decided afterwards whether the goal has been \nachieved or not.\nA• ction-oriented means that the goal describes an out-\ncome of the activities of the athlete. The performance \nof other competitors should not influence the goal.\nR• ealistic means that it is possible that the goal will be \nachieved. For a beginning archer it is not realistic to \nset as goal: ‘Next year I will be the world champion’ . \n‘Next year I will have the same results as this year may \nbe very realistic, but it is not challenging. So, chal-\nlenge is another item.\nT• ime-phased. Time limits given for the goals must be \nclear. (Short range as well as long range).\nE• xigent. Challenging goals motivate the archer to \nwork hard to realize the goal.\nR• ecorded. Writing down the goal helps the archer to \nstay aware of the goal.\nGoals can be subjective (e.g. ‘having fun’) and objective \n(e.g. ‘to win the competition’). A subjective goal is not \nSMART; it is not measurable.\nGoals can be positive or negative. A positive goal puts \nthe focus on success; a negative goal puts the focus on \nfailure. A negative goal tends to change the mind during \nexecution and can harm the performance.\nThere are outcome goals (e.g. ‘to beat a particular op-\nponent’ , ‘a score of 1200’), performance goals (e.g. ‘to \nenter the national team’) and process goals (e.g. ‘relaxing \nthe bow hand after release’).\nOutcome goals, although SMART , can be less effective \nthan performance goals. If the (outcome) goal is ‘win-\nning’ , then the outcome is very uncertain if the competi-\ntors are of equal level. The archer has at best only partial \ncontrol over the outcome and becomes inflexible in the \ngoal-adjustment if it becomes clear during the competi-\ntion that the goal cannot be reached any more. Focusing \non outcome goals can distract the athlete, as they tend to \nworry about the outcome of the event and ‘forgets’ to at -\ntend to their task-relevant strategies.\nA process goal orientates the archer to focus during \nthe execution of the shot on a specific part of the shoot -\ning routine. An example of a process goal for a training \nsession: ‘keep focussed on the relaxation of the wrist joint \nof the bow arm after release’ .\nWhen athletes take part in goal setting they become \nmore involved in the programme and more committed \nbecause they feel responsible to some extent for their \ntasks. Don’t force your athlete to set goals if they have a \nnegative attitude to do so.\nGoals for an exercise\nWhen the coach presents an exercise to their pupil dur -\ning practising it is important to explain the goal of that \nwork out. The athlete appreciates the goal-oriented work \nout and will be motivated to do their best. The exercise \nshould not be too easy, otherwise it does not motivate; on \nthe other hand, it should not be too difficult, as it could \njust create frustration or even de-motivation. It must be \nchallenging. Examples of an objective with appropriate \nexercises:\nObjective Exercise\nT o \nimprove \nphysical \nform\nWe shoot eleven ends, numbered from 1 to 11. In \nthe ends 1 to 6 the number of arrows equals the \nnumber of that end. (So in the first end 1 arrow, \nin the second end 2 arrows, …, in the 6th end 6 \narrows.) In the ends 7 to 11 the number of arrows \nequals 12 minus the number of that end. (So in \nthe 7th end 5 arrows, in the 8th end 4 arrows, …, \nin the 11th end 1 arrow.) ‘Shooting pyramids’\nShooting \nwith \nrelaxed \nbow \nfingers\nTense and release your bow fingers before \nshooting; we shoot an end of three arrows with \nstressed tension on the bow fingers; next we \nshoot some ends with relaxed fingers"}

If, for instance, the bow shoulder will be the topic, \nthen you can conduct in the warm-up part some special \nexercises for arms and shoulders.\nGoals for a competition\nThe goal for an archer in a competition should only de-\npend on the archer‘s performance (and not on the op -\nponents‘ performance). An archer is not at all capable to \ninfluence the opponents‘ performance.\nBefore each competition the archer must set a goal. \n‘Winning’ sounds quite nice, but it will not have the posi-\ntive effects we expect from a goal. The goal must be incor-\nporated in an overall planning for the long term. So, ‘win-\nning’ is not always what counts. A competition may also \nbe ‘training’ for more important competitions to come. \nExample of a goal for a (indoor) competition: ‘T o shoot \nthe first arrow of each end after 30 seconds’ .\nGoals for the short term\nA clear goal for the short term prevents disappointment. \nIf the goal for the short term is realistic, then it gives the \nathlete the feeling that they know what the perspective of \ntheir activities are. A recreational archer can do without a \ngoal; it is enough to have fun. For an archer on level 2 and \nfor elite archers goals for the short term play a role in their \nplanning cycle.\nGoals for the long term\nA goal for the long term helps the archer to stay motivat -\ned. There are examples of some Olympic medallists who, \nalthough being a young and ambitious novice, already put \nas their objective ‘I want to become an Olympic champi-\non’ . Planning on the long term is marked with goals to be \nachieved at fixed dates. Once a goal has been identified, \nit should be recorded by the archer and by the coach. It \nis not inspiring for the archer if they have to do just what \nothers (the coach) have thought to be good for them, so \ninvolve your athletes in setting a goal. An objective for an \narcher on level 2 for a season could be: ‘to shoot all arrows \nin the yellow and the red (with the possible exception of \na miss)’ .\nObjectives for the long term on which athlete and \ntheir coach have agreed serve to motivate their coopera-\ntion. The objective can be ‘to participate in the Olympic \nGames’ , which is very ambitious, or ‘to have a nice time \nduring the hours of practice’ , and anything between.\nFor the long term (several years) the objective could \nbe ‘I want to be among the best in my country’ . T o achieve \nsuch a (middle) long-term plan it is wise to plan this \nachievement in several steps (years). For each step we \nformulate a partial goal.\n7. Frequency of training sessions\nThe human body is a complex system with many physi-\nological processes. These processes play a role in sport \nperformance. Through training sessions we try to im-\nprove our athletes‘ level of shooting technique and qual-\nity of physiological processes. However, one cannot be \ntraining all the time; periods of activity have to alternate \nwith periods of rest. Within certain limits one can choose \n(plan) when to practice, when to compete and when to \ntake a rest. This is the essence of the coach‘s yearly plan-\nning. The periods of rest are more important than some-\ntimes assumed. Shooting a few hundred arrows six days a \nweek is less effective than shooting a deliberate number \n(say 80) of arrows three to four times in a week. A heavy \ntraining session just before an important competition can \nbecome disastrous.\nWith novices we may have one training session each \nweek. On level 2 this is no longer optimum. Archers \nshould practise a few times per week. It is a fact of experi-\nence, that practising archery twice a week is just enough \nnot to forget what has just been practised, so archers on \nlevel 2 should have training at least twice a week. On the \nother hand it is important to give body and mind enough \ntime to recover, which means no shooting for one to three \ndays per week.\nThe skill of shooting must be well trained. In organis -\ning the training sessions it is important that athlete and \ncoach follow a systematically predefined plan.\n8. Learning and teaching\nArchery is a routine or motor skill, which has to be learnt \nlike writing or driving a car. On entry level we find out \nwhat archery is all about; we have ‘learnt’ archery if we \ncan reproduce the shooting routine with great consist -\nency. This takes years of practicing archery two or three \ntimes a week."}

Y ou probably did not interfere \ntoo much in their (poor) technique. Y our archers got the \nconfidence that you as a coach guarantee safety and their \nfirst contact with archery gave them fun. After a while \nyou will conduct your athletes step-by-step to the correct \ntechnical execution of the shot. When all the technical \ndetails have been trained, coaching continues on a higher \nlevel.\nAthletes generally follow their trainer‘s instructions; \nthe coach observes how the archer executes the shot. As \nlong as not all arrows hit the bull’s eye, the coach tries \nto discover what the archer is possibly doing incorrectly. \nThe coach cannot directly observe all the visual and prop-\nrioceptor\n* information that the archer collects during the \nshot nor can the athlete tell that to you.\nThe athlete‘s thinking, remembering and considering \nduring the shot determines the outcome of the execution, \nso it is important for the coach to find out what is going \non in the archer‘s mind.\nIf in a training situation the archer pays special atten-\ntion to one part of the routine, then other parts are often \nbadly executed. By asking the athlete “What did you do? ” \nthe coach gets an idea about the athlete‘s mental focus.\nAs a (quasi) paradox the archer’s performance usu-\nally drops after corrections in technique proposed by the \ncoach. This can be caused by the attention the archer is \npaying to parts of the routine that were previously per -\nformed subconsciously and that are now consciously ex -\necuted for some time. This is a normal experience. After \na certain period of practising the new movement will be \nroutine and executed automatically again. It is therefore \nnot wise for the coach to suggest changes in shooting style \nshortly before a competition. Such corrections should be \nmade preferable after major tournaments.\nWe consider five stages in learning archery.\ns1. Getting the idea of the skill\ns2. Rough coordination\ns3. Fine coordination\n* A proprioceptor is a specialized sensory nerve ending that monitors \ninternal changes in the body brought about by movement and mus-\ncular activity. Proprioceptors located in muscles and tendons trans-\nmit information that is used to coordinate muscular activity\ns4. Refining and performing under various circumstances\ns5. Elite perfection\nThe athlete has to go through these stages, one after the \nother. It is the coach’s responsibility to keep this sequence \nin mind. Always realise at what stage your archer is cur -\nrently learning. In a level 1 course we have to deal with \nstages S1 and S2. On level 2 we have to work on the stages \nS3 and S4. Stage S5 is left over for level 3.\nAn athlete uses different means of learning.\nFeedback of the result at the target.• \nVerbal feedback from the coach such as ‘well done! ’ • \nor a comment on the execution of a specific task.\nNon-verbal feedback from the coach such as ‘thumb • \nhigh’ . If the coach usually gives verbal feedback, a si-\nlence can also be meaningful.\nImitation or model learning. On level 1 young archers • \nlike to copy a popular archer’s shooting style, some-\ntimes from a movie. If this ‘model’ has the perfect \nshooting style that fits the pupil there is no problem, \nbut mostly it is not advisable to imitate fully another \nathlete’s shooting performance. The coach can use \nthe ability of model learning by showing a posture or \nmovement to the archer. Use a good model (yourself \nor somebody else) to show the shooting sequence \nand use a video camera or a mirror to show this ath-\nlete’s performance.\nUnderstanding. If we understand that moving the • \nsight pin for example to the left, leads to holding the \nbow more to the right, we know how to correct the \nsight if the arrows hit left. We can use standard rules \nsuch as ‘Follow the arrows with the sight pin’ .\nMethods of teaching\nThe coach can use one or more of the following methods \nof teaching.\nThe fragmentation or checklist method\nThe shooting routine is divided into a sequence of about \n10 isolated steps. These steps are practised with the bow. \nThe advantage is that the athlete can easily carry out these \nsteps separately. The disadvantage is that the archer may \ncontinue to analyse all these steps of their acting, which \nin a stressful situation leads to convulsive movements and \ndecreasing results. The isolated steps may not evaluate \ninto a smooth routine, which is the biggest disadvantage \nin this method."}

Each part must be practised on its own and with-\nout the bow. After having practised the parts separately, \nthey are put together using the bow. A great advantage \nof this method is that a lot of mistakes in the shooting \ntechnique are avoided. T eaching can be very efficient, \nwith relatively big groups of athletes. It is very difficult in \nmany countries of the world, however, to motivate ath-\nletes to practice ‘archery without a bow’ , even when the \nadvantage is evident.\nThe comprehensive method\nThe movement is executed as being undividable. If neces-\nsary, elements such as raising the bow arm can be prac-\nticed separately, but are as soon as possible reintegrated \nin the overall movement. The comprehensive method \nof learning can easily lead to a personal shooting style, \nwhich could be seen as a disadvantage.\nFor the above-mentioned reasons we prefer a combi-\nnation of the analytic and the comprehensive methods \nof teaching. Don’t be afraid that your archers on the 2nd \nlevel will make a lot of mistakes. It is part of learning. Peo-\nple learn also by experience. After having been shooting \nin their own style without a high score, the athlete will be \ninterested to listen to the coach’s suggestions.\nIf the coach teaches an inadequate kind of style, the \narcher will learn this form and the scores will drop per -\nmanently. It is very hard to get rid of an improper style in \na later stage.\nExplicit versus implicit learning\nIn a training session the coach makes remarks on the \nshooting style of the archers and gives them a task to focus \non in the next ends. These suggestions of the coach can be \nbased on explicit learning and on implicit learning.\nUsing explicit learning, nothing is left to the imagina-\ntion of the archer; the archer has to do just what the coach \ndescribes, the coach tries to stay as close as possible to the \nideal technical execution of the shot by the archer.\nImplicit learning leaves a lot of things to the archer \nto discover themselves. If the coach observes that the \narcher has a collapsed stance, they can use the words \n“Make yourself tall” , leaving to the archer to discover \nthe translation “Stretch your spine, cant your pelvis” . \nUsing analogies is another example of implicit learning. \nFor instance the remark “Keep the bow in your hand as \nif you keep a little bird in it; if you open it, the bird is \ngone, if you pinch too much, the bird is dead” leaves to \nthe archer to discover that the bow fingers should be \nrelaxed.\nExplicit learning works faster than implicit learn-\ning, especially at the beginning of the learning process. \nImplicit learned skills are less sensitive to stress than \nexplicit learned ones (‘choking under pressure’) and \ntherefore have a significant advantage above explicit \nlearned ones.\nA coach who wants to use implicit learning tries to of-\nfer a task to the archer, where the archers themselves to \nfind out how to adapt their technique. For instance you \nfix an extra target face just above the ground; you tell your \narcher to pull the bow and to aim on the lower face, not \nloosing the arrow and to move the point of aim with the \ndrawn bow to the upper target and then release. The arch-\ner has to find out how to swing the body around the hips, \nmaintaining the T-shape.\n9. Relaxation techniques\nStress is the human process whereby an individual per -\nceives a threat and responds with a series of psychologi-\ncal and physiological changes such as increased mental \narousal and muscular tension. For sport performance \nstress should be avoided.\nArousal may either facilitate or inhibit sport perform-\nance. In the absence of arousal high performance is not \npossible; too much arousal can cause stress. The ability \nto regulate arousal levels is an important mental skill. \nMostly the archer needs to relax; sometimes psyching up \nis needed to reach the optimum level of arousal. With re-\nlaxation techniques athletes can lower their general mus-\ncular tension under any condition.\nIn a situation of a competition or championship there \nwill be increased mental arousal. Relaxation can facilitate \nrecovery during the short time between two ends of ar -\nrows. An archer must learn to communicate with their \nbody, i.e. to learn how to self-regulate arousal.\nRelaxation teaches the athlete to regulate tension so \nthat the nerve pathways to the muscles are never over -\ncharged. Relaxation also promotes the onset of sleep and \nreduces insomnia problems that plague many athletes \nprior to competition. On the other hand, relaxation tech-\nniques can also help when the archer is fatigued.\nSome methods of relaxation or diminishing a high \npermanent arousal (stress) are controlled breathing, pro-\ngressive muscular relaxation and meditation."}

A good \nbreathing rhythm has to be an automatism. It is a normal \nreaction on anxiety to stress the upper breathing instead \nof using diaphragm (lower breathing). It’s actually a sign \nof fear; yawning and sighing are other signs.\nThe recommended breathing uses the diaphragm \nrather than the intercostals (chest) muscles. The con-\nscious effort of paying attention to one’s breathing may \nrelieve anxiety: one cannot consciously concentrate on \nboth, breathing and worry. In contrast to upper breath-\ning yawning and sighing are active means to create and/\nor support relaxation\nProgressive muscular relaxation\nProgressive muscular relaxation can give the feeling of the \ndifference between tense and relaxed bodily sensations \nby alternately contracting and relaxing designated mus -\ncle groups; it can reduce body tensions that harm good \nexecution of a shot.\n10. Mental preparation\nPre-performance (pre-shot) routines\nWatching (elite) archers, you may observe different pre-\nshot routines. Examples are watching a fixed point any -\nwhere in space before each shot, moving the body weight \nfrom one foot to the other (Cf. the three times bouncing \nof the ball on the ground before the serve by a tennis play-\ner), putting your quiver in place (as if it was not already \nthere) and so on. Pre-performance routines provide time \nfor liberation of task-non-relevant thoughts and to focus \non task-relevant observations.\nPre-shot routines are executed subconsciously, most \narchers are not aware of them. Pre-shot routines serve \nseveral reasons. They help to make the archer’s mind free \nfrom all that happened just before behind the shooting \nline: your all-day talks, the score, all advice you got from \ndifferent people. Pre-performance routines belong to \nthe shooting routine; a coach should not try to abandon \nthem. Executing pre-performance routines is an archer’s \npersonal start to get into the state of concentration.\nInstructional self-talk\nWhat athletes think or say is critical for performance. \nThoughts directly affect feelings and ultimately actions. \nAppropriate or positive thinking leads to optimistic feel-\nings and good performance; inappropriate or misguided \nthinking leads to negative feelings and poor perform-\nance.\nExamples of positive thinking are ‘I achieve my goal’ , \n‘I have confidence’ , and ‘I will win this game’ . Examples \nof inappropriate thinking are ‘I can not win this game’; ‘I \nwill not have a high score to day’ .\nAnytime you think about something, you are in a sense \ntalking to yourself. Such instructional self-talk can help \nthe archer to keep appropriately focussed in the present, \nnot staying with past mistakes or projecting good results \ninto the future. Examples of instructional self-talk are ‘I \nkeep my bow elbow in position’ , ‘I keep my release fingers \nrelaxed’ or ‘I move my scapula to my spine’ .\n‘If I shoot 28 again in the next end, I break my personal \nrecord’ is an example of projection into the future, which \noften does not lead to the desired result.\nVisualisation\nVisualisation (mentally rehearsal of the shot) is see-\ning and feeling oneself performing a skilled movement \n(launching an arrow) in one’s imagination. Archers may \n(they actually should) use visualisation in a training ses -\nsion prior to the actual shot. Visualisation just before a \nshot suppresses non-relevant task thoughts. Visualisation \ndoes not offer feedback similar to the actual shot like ki-\nnaesthetic sensations or score.\nIn a relaxed situation, an archer may sit down, the eyes \nclosed, and imagine how they go to the shooting line, take \nthe appropriate stance, nock an arrow, focus with the eye on \nthe gold, raise the bow, draw, anchor and complete the shot.\nAs visualization occupies the mind, it is not a good \nidea to use visualisation on the shooting line during peri-\nods and/or actions requiring a lot of care. A mind free of \nthoughts is characteristic for the state of concentration.\n11. Getting into the state of concentration on the \nshooting line\nFor a good performance the athlete needs to know how \nto get into the state of concentration on the shooting line. \nThe major element of concentration is the ability to focus \none’s attention on the task at hand and thereby not to al-\nlow to be disturbed or affected by irrelevant external and \ninternal stimuli.\nIt is not so easy to get into the state of concentration; \nyou cannot achieve it just ‘by demand’ . The following \nconditions have to be fulfilled.\nThe archer must be motivated.• \nThe archer must have one clear goal.•"}

T emporarily forget everything • \nthat is not exclusively involved in your shooting.\nThe archer must be physically fit and should not have • \nany (major) injuries.

Other people can be the \nopponent, the spectators, the coach or a judge. This is a \ngeneral phenomenon, called social facilitation.\nFocusing attention\nFocussing attention sustains alertness and keeps you \nfree from distraction. At the start of the shooting rou-\ntine the archer has freed their mind from task non-rel-\nevant thoughts and things that happen around them \noccupy the attention. On raising the bow the notice \nshould be focussed on one single point of attention. \nThere are thousands of possible points of attention, \nspecific and internal for the archer such as: my stance, \nthe movement of my scapula, my bow shoulder, my \nbreathing, and outlining my bow, but also general and \nexternal such as the effect of the wind. The point of fo -\ncus is a personal preference of the archer. By directing \nthe attention on one point, all the (other) elements of \na good shot could be executed subconsciously, that is \nin the state of concentration.\n‘The focus on the centre of the body’ in Eastern ar -\nchery literature is equivalent to ‘The state of concentra-\ntion’ in western terminology.\nRelaxation techniques and goal setting can harm fo -\ncussing and are therefore not appropriate on the shooting \nline during competition.\n12. Feedback and pitfalls\nKinaesthetic sensation is the feeling that the archer has \nimmediately after the shot, even when the arrow has not \nyet hit the target. Elite archers rely more on kinaesthetic \nfeedback than on visual feedback, i.e. score.\nAfter a perfect end there is little physical feedback: \nthe athlete is not capable to report afterwards what they \ndid right and what they did wrong. The usual reaction is \n“everything went correct; it felt quite nice” . We do have \na pitfall here: the athlete is so excited of their perfect \nperformance, that they are enjoying it in the next end, \ninstead of focussing the mind ‘from zero’ . We call this \nmental pitfall ‘euphoria’ .\nAfter a non-perfect end the athlete can easily formulate \nall the mistakes they made. At the next end they can use this \ninformation. However, this is also a pitfall. The focus will \nnot be on the task-relevant elements, but on all the mistakes \nthey remember. They tend to focus in a negative way, trying \nto ‘avoid’ these mistakes, thinking ‘this and that should not \ngo wrong’ . As we have seen before, in learning and teaching, \nfocussing on parts of the shooting routine can easily lead to \nbad execution of other parts and/or even the whole shot.\n13. Archery is a game\nThe execution of a shot should happen spontaneously \nand automatically, in the state of flow. Archers should not \nbe concentrating too much on their score. A good coach \nwants them to perform as comfortable as possible. A nice \npace (rhythm and tempo) is more important for the shot \nthan the knowledge about their own and/or the oppo -\nnents’ intermediate standings.\nWe can divide the activities of archery into three parts: \n(technique) training sessions, shooting a tournament \nand doing some recreational archery. The importance of \nrecreational archery should not be neglected. Informal \nmatches with colleague archers are also considered as \n‘recreation’ .\nArchery should be practised also ‘for enjoyment’ . De-\npending on the circumstances, the elements stance, ex -\necution of the shot and score play a different role. There \nis a relation between these elements and the activities of \nthe archer.

Archers tend to ‘neglect’ \nthe stance, but they try to perform the movement as \nwell as possible.\nShooting in bad weather conditions\nA good coach assists his athletes in learning to perform in \ndifferent circumstances.\nIn many parts of the world archery training sessions \noften take place indoor, where circumstances do not \nchange. If we were training only indoors, the archer will \nbe facing problems when competing outdoor. The tour -\nnament fields always differ from the training indoor facil-\nity. Shooting outdoor implies a lot of disturbances. There \nmay be wind! There may be some trees behind the butt \nthat in general are not straight or vertical. The grass can be \ncut skew to the target, and so on.\nWe can train to anticipate these situations by intro -\nducing an element of ‘game’ in our training sessions. This \nmeans that we try to deal with all kinds of ‘changing cir -\ncumstances’ . For instance you can change the route the \narcher has to go from the equipment area to the shoot -\ning line by introducing some obstacles like a chair etc. In \npractising indoors we could change the lighting.\nBy introducing such ‘games’ we can increase attention \nand create a situation in which certain parts of the shoot-\ning technique are practised unperceived and without \neffort.

On the shooting line archers are very \nserious and try to perform their best, i.e. in the state of \nconcentration. However, between the shooting sessions \nit is time to relax. The archer empties their mind from the \ncompetition by a (sometimes more than) relaxed behav-\niour. It is a matter of personal character, some people are \nintrovert; others are extrovert. For the team in the ideal \nsituation there is a mix of characters each with their own \npersonality.\nLiterature\nRichard H.

Two archers \nshooting the exact same bow, same poundage and the \nsame arrow length may not necessarily shoot the same \narrow size. Usually, the archer who has better “line” , (see \nshooting form chapter for details on body alignment) will \nshoot a lighter (weaker) spined arrow than an archer who \nhas poor skeletal alignment. This is because the archer \nwith good alignment creates less side movement of the \nstring on release resulting in less column loading of the \narrow shaft.\nInstall All Accessories\nBefore starting the bow tuning process, be sure to install \nevery piece of equipment on your bow that you intend \nto use during shooting. This includes the correct bow -\nstring and all attachments to the bow string, bow sight, \nstabilizers, arrow rest, cushion plunger, counter weights \netc. Choose all personal items as well, like your tab, chest \nprotector and any thing else you use when shooting.

By \nfollowing the bow setup guidelines in the initial prepara-\ntion of your equipment, you can eliminate most or all of \nthe possible tuning problems that can make the process \ntime consuming and unsuccessful.\nAdjustments made to the bow, changes in bow com-\nponents, or alterations in shooting form can affect the \ntune or your equipment. Remember, you and your equip-\nment share a unique relationship and are totally inte-\ngrated. Any change to either will produce varying results. \nDuring the tuning process, it is vitally important that you \nchange only one variable at a time. Otherwise, it is very \ndifficult to determine what adjustment caused any group-\ning changes. If, after trying all of the tuning adjustments \noutlined in this chapter, your arrows still do not fly true, it \nmay be necessary to change your arrow size to a stiffer or \nweaker shaft and retune.\nArrows in flight spin, vibrate and oscillate in the hori-\nzontal plane, and can oscillate in the vertical plane with a \nmisplaced nocking point. Proper bow-set up and tuning \nwill help minimize the forces on the arrow and help the \narcher to achieve optimum performance. Unfortunately, \nthere are many theories on arrow flight and vigorous \nmathematical treatment of these is a bit hard for most \nnon-engineers to understand.

If, after trying all of the tuning adjustments \noutlined in this chapter, your arrows still do not fly true, it \nmay be necessary to change your arrow size to a stiffer or \nweaker shaft and retune.\nArrows in flight spin, vibrate and oscillate in the hori-\nzontal plane, and can oscillate in the vertical plane with a \nmisplaced nocking point. Proper bow-set up and tuning \nwill help minimize the forces on the arrow and help the \narcher to achieve optimum performance. Unfortunately, \nthere are many theories on arrow flight and vigorous \nmathematical treatment of these is a bit hard for most \nnon-engineers to understand.

If the archer is shooting \na left handed bow the same comments apply but in re-\nverse.\nAs the archer releases the arrow, the string moves hori-\nzontally to the left (facing the target) moving the nock to \nthe left. As the string starts to move forward moving the \nnock end of the arrow, the point end resists this move and \nthis results in the arrow bending toward the bow. When \nthe arrow completes this initial bend, the string and nock \nmove back toward centre and then to the right of centre. \nAt this moment the front section of the arrow pushes \nagainst the sight window face or a cushion plunger if fit -\nted. All of this action occurs in a fraction of a second in \nthe first several inches of forward travel of the arrow. In \nthe next horizontal bending sequence as the arrow leaves \nthe bow face and arrow rest the arrow is in a nearly free \nmode, only being held by the bowstring during this sec-\nond half cycle. At the end of this complete cycle (bending \nin toward then bending away from the bow), the arrow \nnock disengages from the bowstring sending the arrow \non its way to the target. These actions of the arrow are \ntermed “ Archer’s Paradox” and are the cause of arrow vi-\nbration and arrow horizontal oscillation.\nFigure 3.\nThe drawing shows the posi-\ntion of the fingers at full draw \nand at the time of the release, \nthe path of the string and the \ninitial bending of the arrow as \nthe string propels it \ntoward the target.\nFigure 1.\nFigure 2."}

This is particularly true of shooting in \nthe wind. The term used to describe the location of the \narrow’s balance point is foc. It is defined as how far the \nbalance point is forward of the arrow’s mid point and is \nexpressed as a percentage of total arrow length.\nFOC L/2B\nL= − ×100\nWhere: L is arrow length\nB is length from balance point to front of arrow\nFor outdoor shooting, many archers assemble their ar -\nrows with quite a high Front of Centre balance point, \nthough this depends on the type of arrows being assem-\nbled, the length of arrow and the poundage/speed of the \nbow. Consideration must be given to acquiring a good \nsight mark at the longest distance being shot. For indoor \nshooting a high Front of Centre balance point may be \nused but be aware that going too high may be detrimental \nto the performance required.\nTuning and Bow Set-up\nTuning and bow set-up are the processes by which the \narcher can adjust the bow and arrow so that the flight \nproblems caused by the Archer’s Paradox can be mini-\nmized and good arrow grouping can be achieved. The \ntuning process is a whole system process wherein the \nbow, all of its attachments, the arrow and the archer can \nbe brought into harmony. Any change, simple as it may \nseem, can affect bow tune. Something as simple as a new \nset of finger tabs can have a dramatic affect on a finely \ntuned bow. The tuning process is a discipline wherein the \nshooting characteristics of the arrow are modified to op -\ntimize performance. Bow set-up is a series of equipment \nbased tasks whereas tuning is required to accommodate \nthe shot variations caused by the archer. Properly made, \nmatched arrows will group tightly when shot out of a \nshooting machine however an archer shooting the same \nequipment will experience shot variation.\nBow Set-up\nInstall All Accessories\nBefore starting the bow tuning process, be sure to install \nevery piece of equipment on your bow that you intend \nto use during shooting. This includes the correct bow -\nstring and all attachments to the bow string, bow sight, \nstabilizers, arrow rest, cushion plunger, counter weights \netc. Choose all personal items as well as, your tab, chest \nprotector and anything else you use when shooting. For \nexample, simply changing a stabilizer can have an enor -\nmous effect on the tune of your bow.\nOnce the equipment is fully assembled, the next phase \nin the process of achieving well tuned equipment is a \ngood preliminary setup. If the initial/preliminary setup is \ndone properly, the tuning process can be accomplished \nwith little effort. By following these bow setup guidelines \nin the initial preparation of your equipment, you can \neliminate many of the possible tuning problems that can \nmake the process time consuming and unsuccessful. Ad-\njustments made to the bow, changes in bow components, \nor alterations in shooting form can affect the tune of your \nequipment. Remember, you and your equipment share a \nunique relationship and are totally integrated. Any change \nto either will produce varying results. During the tuning \nprocess, it is vitally important that you change only one \nvariable at a time. Otherwise, it is very difficult to deter -\nmine what adjustment caused any grouping change.\nNock-to-Bowstring Fit\nThe force necessary to separate the nock from the bow -\nstring serving is very critical, especially on light draw-\nweight bows (35 lbs. and under). Nock tension should \nbe tight enough so the arrow can easily support its own \nweight when the arrow is hung from the bowstring in a \nhorizontal position but weak enough so that the arrow \nwill fall if the string is tapped sharply with your finger (see \nfigure 4 below). In order to get the proper nock fit you \ncan use either a large or small groove nock or adjust the \nserving diameter by choosing different serving thread di-\nameters. If the string tension is too loose, there is a danger \nof the nock slipping off the string at full draw causing a \ndry fire. This could not only damage the bow, but can also \ncause a serious bruise to the archers bow arm.\nFigure 4."}

Rests range from the \nsimple stick on plastic variety to adjustable metal arms \nwhich move away from the arrow as it is shot. The high \nspeed films described earlier show that the main function \nof the rest is to support the arrow during draw and dur -\ning the initial movement of the arrow forward. As archer’s \nparadox takes place the arrow lifts off the rest. The rest \nneeds to be adjusted so that the centre of the arrow is con-\ntacting the centre of the cushion plunger (Figure 5), and \nthe support arm must be adjusted so that it is not visible \npast the outside of the arrow shaft when observed from \nan overhead view (figure 6).\nFigure 5\nAngle of arrow rest arm &\nPlunger alignment with the arrow.\nFigure 6\nArrow Rest Arm.\nInstall the Nocking Point\nThis is a common step with all recurve bows. Install a \nmoveable nocking point on the bowstring. Clamp-on \ntypes are satisfactory and easy to install but affect arrow \nflight. We suggest that you use a tie on nocking point.\nIncorrect Incorrect Correct\n Incorrect Correct \nInitial Nocking Point Position.\nFigure 7.\nInitially, position the nocking point on the bowstring \nabout 5mm (1/4 inch) above square (Figure 7).\nThe nock of the arrow will be placed above this nock -\ning point. After this nocking point is in place tie a 2nd \nnocking above the first one with sufficient room between \nthe two points so that a nock will easily fit between. This \nwill prevent an arrow from sliding down the string during \nshooting.\nTying on a Nocking Point\nThe tied on nocking point is made with a short piece, 30-\n50cm (12-20˝) of the same serving material used to serve \nthe string. Begin by tying an overhand knot around the \nbowstring serving. Next take the free ends, turn them un-\nder the bowstring and tighten the knot. Alternate knots \nabove and below the string until you have tied 8-10 knots. \nEnd the nocking point by tying the final knot in a square \nknot. Cut off the loose ends to about 5mm (1/4˝) length \nand heat them with a match or lighter. They will burn back \nto the main knot and fuse the fibres of the string you used \nfor the nocking point. This nocking point can be moved \nup or down the serving by twisting it since it acts like a \nnut and the served string as the screw. This is the reason \nyou should use the same material as you used for the serv-\ning since you get a perfect thread match.\n90°\nHave the top of the \nbo/t_tom nocking point \napproximately 5 \nmillimetres above \nsquare."}

Measure the width of each limb and make \na small vertical mark on the tape in the exact centre of \neach limb about 15cm (6 in.) from the limb pockets of the \nriser. Be very accurate when doing this and measure sev -\neral times to know you have located the exact centre of \neach limb. This mark will be used for arrow centering. It \nmay be easier to see if the string is centralised if two lines \nare marked on the limb, instead of one, which are 3 mil-\nlimetres apart. With one line this line would be hidden \nbehind the string when alignment is being checked. More \nconveniently use commercially available “Limb Line \nGauges” available from most good archery shops.\nAfter you mark the limb centres on the tape or install \nthe Limb Line Gauges, stand back and attempt to sight \nalign the string with the 2 marks. If you cannot do this \nyou will need to either average the alignment or if your \nbow has the capability of adjusting limb alignment, do so. \nThis is most easily accomplished by placing one marked \ntape where the limb comes out of the riser and one tape \nat 15cm (6in.) from the bow tip on both limbs (or use spe-\ncific gauges). Y ou can then check the alignment of the 4 \nmarks to assess if the limbs are properly aligned (Figure \n12). Stand back and sight through the string to see if it \ncovers all 4 marks. If not, make limb alignment adjust -\nments as required.\nSome bows may have a slightly bent riser or crooked \nlimbs. In this case, since the string will not perfectly bisect \nthe centre of both limbs at the same time, you will need \nto compensate or average the string position for the slight \nimbalance. This does not mean the bow will not shoot ac-\ncurately, it simply means you need to compensate for this \nsituation.\nFigure 12.\n“Centering” the Arrow: Adjusting the Arrow’s Left/\nRight Position\nThe objective of arrow centering is to have the arrow leave \nthe bow in the same vertical plane as the average string \nforce moves. T o accomplish this, the archer should stand \nbehind the bow which is held in a vertical position and \nsight forward through the string which is aligned with \nthe bow centreline. See Figure 13 for proper arrow center-\ning. The arrow should be moved in or out from the bow \nso that the point appears just to the left of the string. For \nbows equipped with a cushion plunger this can be accom-\nplished by turning it in or out. Bows without a cushion \nplunger can be built out from the bow face if the arrow \nmust be moved left however if the point is already outside \nof the string it is impossible to move the point further \nright because of the riser.\nFigure 13.

The one object of the tuning process \nwhich follows is to select the correct arrow and bow ad-\njustment so that the arrow is aimed and moves forward \nin the force plane of the moving bowstring as the arrow \nis shot. Y ou will notice a number of archers whose sight \nis either outside or inside the string. This is because they \nhave tuned their bows to an improper initial arrow align-\nment or are using arrows either too stiff or too weak for \ntheir set-up.\nNotes on Clickers\nThere are several things to be aware of when using \na clicker. Be sure that the arrow is well supported \non the rest and not held in place only by the tension \nof the clicker. Draw the bow a few times without the \nclicker to make sure the arrow can be drawn and let \ndown without the arrow falling off the arrow rest. The \nclicker tension and angle are important too. The clicker \nshould not be so stiff that it actually moves the cush-\nion plunger in or places a downward pressure on the \narrow. T o test this, stand in front of a target (just in case \nyou have an unexpected loose of the string) and draw \nthe arrow through the clicker as if you were going to \nshoot, but do not shoot the arrow. Rather, watch only \nthe arrow on the rest to detect any movement of the \narrow at the moment the arrow is pulled through the \nclicker and the clicker makes contact with the riser. If \nthere is any movement of the arrow, either a bounce on \nthe arrow rest or the arrow moves out due to cushion \nplunger activation, you need to correct this. There must \nnot be any observable movement of the arrow when the \nclicker is activated.\nSet the Cushion Plunger Pressure\nIf the bow is equipped with a cushion plunger, set the \nplunger tension to 40% of the tension of the lightest \nspring. The setting will change later on in the tuning \nprocess. If you don’t use a cushion plunger, your tuning \nadjustments are going to be far more limited in the tuning \nprocess.\nSetting Initial Brace Height\nStart with the brace height at the lower end of the manu-\nfacturer’s recommendation range or use the following \nchart.\n64˝ 8 1/8˝–8 3/8˝ (21.0 cm–21.6 cm)\n66˝ 8 1/4˝–8 1/2˝ (21.3 cm–21.9 cm)\n68˝ 8 3/8˝–8 5/8˝ (21.6 cm–22.2 cm)\n70˝ 8 1/2˝–8 3/4˝ (21.7 cm–22.5 cm)\nThe manufacturer recommended brace height setting is \nonly a guideline. Changing the brace height to a slightly \nhigher or lower position can affect arrow flight and group-\ning. The proper setting for best arrow grouping perform-\nance will be determined later in the tuning section.\nTiller\nTiller is the term used to describe the relative bending \nof both bow limbs. It is assessed by measuring the per -\npendicular distance between the bow string and limb at \nthe end of the limb pockets. By convention, the readings \nare made in reference to the upper limb reading. Hence, a \npositive tiller is one where the distance from the string to \nthe upper limb at the limb pocket (a) is greater than the \ndistance for the lower limb (b), see figure 15.\nFigure 15.\nA negative tiller is where the lower reading is greater. For \nmany years it was accepted that a positive tiller was re-\nquired since the archer was grasping the string above the \nbow centre and held the string with one finger above and \ntwo below the arrow nock and was a result of the pres -\nsure point of the hand on the riser. Recently most archers \nadjust the tiller to zero or leave it where the manufacturer \n(a)\n(b)"}

The latter is probably a bad idea since \nsome limb pairs as purchased can have an initial tiller as \nhigh as 20mm (3/4 inch).\nSome archers and coaches feel that it is necessary to \nadjust the tiller to keep the sight steady on the target. T o \ndo this, make very small adjustments to tiller (less than \n2mm at a time) and see how your sight pattern is affected. \nAnother indication that the tiller is correct is the bow \nhand will feel like one concentrated point rather than \na slight rocking feeling in the hand. On the other hand, \nmany archers and coaches set the tiller at zero and leave \nit there.\nOne note of caution. Changing tiller moves the loca-\ntion of the nocking point and its position must be read-\njusted after each change in tiller. Increasing tiller moves \nthe nocking point down and reducing tiller moves the \nnocking point up in relation to the arrow rest. The nock -\ning point must be relocated after each tiller change. Do \nnot use tiller adjustments as a means of moving the nock-\ning point since changes in tiller affect how the bow per -\nforms.\nSetting the Final Brace Height\nAll bows are different, even bows of the same make and \nmodel can have small variations in limb length. There-\nfore, it is important to locate a brace height that fits your \nparticular bow and shooting style. Shoot a few arrows at \nthe suggested beginning brace height, then unstring the \nbow, add 3-4 twists to the bowstring and shoot again. \nContinue this process until the bow feels smoothest and \nquietest when shooting.\nIf the bowstring is too short to allow a brace height \nat the lower setting, use a slightly longer string. If the \nstring is too long to allow a higher brace height (and \nstarts to knot-up from too many twists), try a slightly \nshorter bowstring. There are many custom bowstring \nmakers who produce strings to your exact specifications \nincluding length, type of material, number of strands in \nthe string and type and colour of serving. If there are \na lot of twists in the string, it will take fewer twists to \nincrease brace height than if there are few twists in the \nstring. Also, it is not recommended to have too many \ntwists in the string or it will act more like a spring than \na string. But, there should be enough twists to make it \nlook like a nice round cable.\nTuning\nGeneral\nAfter the bow is set-up as outlined above, the archer may \nbegin the tuning process.\nAs described earlier, the finger release causes the arrow \nto vibrate and to oscillate in the horizontal plane. Arrow \nflight appears to follow a snake like movement pattern. \nThese movements of the arrow are caused by archer’s \nparadox where the string moves around the fingers on re-\nlease. The goal of tuning is to select and adjust an arrow’s \nflight characteristics to minimize these effects and to get \nthe arrow to leave the bow with zero deg. angular rotation. \nIt will still be vibrating but these vibrations are dampened \nout in the first 20-25m of flight by drag forces on the ar -\nrow shaft. Tuning will also minimize the archer’s shooting \nform variability and help him get smaller groups.\nY our shooting technique can have a large influence \nover the dynamic properties of your arrow. Two archers \nshooting the exact same bow, same poundage and the \nsame arrow length may not necessarily require the same \narrow size. Usually, the archer who has better “line” , (see \nshooting form chapter for details on body alignment) \nwill shoot a lighter (weaker) spined arrow than an arch-\ner who has poor skeletal alignment. This is because the \narcher with good alignment creates less side movement \nof the string on release resulting in less initial bending of \nthe arrow shaft.\nAs will be shown shortly, there are a number of inter -\nacting tuning variables which can be employed to best \ntune your system. There is not one unique set-up of these \nvariables to achieve the desired minimum group size you \nare seeking. In fact, it is normal to be able to achieve a \ngood bow tune with more than one stiffness grade of ar -\nrow. With this in mind, many people prefer to tune their \nbow with a stiffer arrow because it is believed to be more \nforgiving. Forgiving in this sense is that the arrow will \nreadily accommodate variations in the archers shooting \ntechnique.\nTuning is best carried out as a statistical process. Each \narrow should be numbered to see if there is any flight \nbias, good or bad, associated with that arrow. The archer \nshould shoot more than the minimum of shots to charac-\nterize their arrow flight. For example, if the method calls \nfor shooting 1 or 3 arrows from a given distance it is sug-\ngested that the archer shoots at least 6 shots. The archer \ncan then eliminate or discount any obvious poor shots \nfrom consideration."}

Many depend on \nthe use of bare shafts as a primary reference for fletched \narrow flight. Bare shafts do not have good flight charac-\nteristics unless the bow is fairly well tuned. Some of the \ntuning methods used and comments on them are:\nPaper Tuning: Primarily a compound bow with release \naid tuning method. Because of archer’s paradox and the \nresultant arrow flight this method has little validity for \npeople using their fingers to release the arrow.\nWalk Back Tuning: Involves shooting arrows at distanc-\nes of 20-40 metres without moving the sight and aiming \nat the same point and then analyzing the hit pattern. This \nmethod is not sufficiently sensitive in tuning carbon/alu-\nminium shafts but is said to work satisfactorily with alu-\nminium arrows.\nShort Distance Tuning: This method involves shoot -\ning fletched arrows at a vertical and a horizontal line. It is \nused mainly to verify nocking point and cushion plunger \nin/out setting.\nBare Shaft Planing T est: This method compares the \ngrouping pattern of bare and fletched shafts. It produces \ngood results but shooting bare shafts before a good tune \nis achieved may be frustrating for the archer.\nFletched Arrow Group Tuning: This method has been \nused for many years and does not have a name. It is prob-\nably the simplest method that yields the best results of \nother tuning methods and is highly recommended. It can \nalso involve shooting bare shafts but not before a basic \ntune is established.\nTuning Tools\nIn all of the tuning methods a number of variables can \nbe used to adjust the shooting characteristics of an arrow. \nAll of the following deal with the arrow’s dynamic spine \nwhich is the amount of initial bend the arrow undergoes \nas the string is released. It is how weak or stiff the arrow is \nas it is shot. Most frequently this characteristic is referred \nto as the arrow’s spine. Unfortunately, arrow manufactur-\ners also use the same term, spine, to describe the stiff-\nness of their shafts. These two “spines” are really “static \nspine” or the stiffness of the arrow at rest as measured by \na spine or deflection tester and “dynamic spine” which is \nthe bending characteristics of an arrow as it is shot from \nthe bow.\nFactors Affecting Dynamic Spine\nDynamic spine is affected by a number of factors, most of \nwhich can be adjusted to improve arrow flight.\nAdjustments to increase dynamic spine, “making the ar-\nrow shoot stiffer\ndecrease point weight• \nadd weight to the nock end of the arrow• \nshorten the shaft• \ndecrease bow weight• \ndecrease brace height. Be careful here as this gives a • \nlonger power stroke thus makes the arrow seem weak-\ner.\nincrease string weight• \nchange arrows to a stiffer shaft size, i.e., lower static • \nspine value.\nAdjustments to decrease dynamic spine, “making the arrow \nshoot weaker or bend more”\nincrease point weight• \nlengthen the shaft• \nincrease bow weight• \nincrease brace height be careful here as this gives a • \nshorter power stroke thus makes the arrow seem stiff-\ner.\ndecrease string weight• \nchange arrows to a weaker shaft size, i.e., increase stat-• \nic spine value.\nThere are some limitations in applying these changes. The \npoint weights are determined by what the archer can pur-\nchase. If the archer is using aluminium arrows he can add \nlead to the inside of the point to increase its weight. It is \nobvious that you can cut off some of the arrows shaft to \nshorten it but you can’t lengthen the shaft without pur -\nchasing new shafts. If you increase bow weight you may \nget to the point the bow is too heavy for you to control.\nBowstring\nServing weight (centre serving) can affect dynamic spine. \nFor example, monofilament centre serving will cause the \narrow to react stiffer than lighter weight nylon centre \nserving. Simply changing from a metal nocking point to \na “tie-on” nocking point can have a noticeable affect on"}

It is also normal \nfor the bare shafts to hit just outside the fletched shaft \ngroup. Since bare shafts are lighter than fletched shafts \nand have a no rear weight (the fletchings), depending on \nthe distance being shot, it might be expected that the un-\nfletched shafts would hit higher and to the left (right hand \narcher) of the fletched shafts.\nStarting the Tuning Process\nFollow the many available manufacturers’ spine charts to \nselect the arrow size recommended for your draw length \nand bow poundage to use as a starting point in develop -\ning the proper arrows for you. Read all of the informa-\ntion provided on the proper use of the chart. Many peo -\nple have found that the arrow sizes recommended by the \nmanufacturer is at least one stiffness grade too stiff so it \nmay be wise to try the arrows or pick one grade less stiff \nshaft as a starting point.\nVerification that you have selected the correct spine \nwill be determined during the tuning process. Problems \ncaused by improperly spined arrow shafts will become \nevident during this process. Before tuning, be sure that all \narrows are straight, properly fletched, and have perfectly \naligned nocks. Now that you have completed the prelimi-\nnary adjustments and properly set up your bow, you are \nready to start the tuning process.\nEstablishing a Basic Tune\nIt is suggested that you begin with the Bare Shaft test. \nShoot bare shafts at a target at 5m. In this way you will \nsee how the shaft leaves the bow and you can adjust your \nnocking point and cushion plunger as needed. Adjust the \nnocking point as shown in Figure 16.\nFigure 16.\nFigure 17.\nFishtailing: (caused buy mismatched arrow \nspine).\nIf the arrow leaves the bow with the nock end leaning to \none side or the other, fishtailing occurs.

If your bow weight is adjustable, increase the bow \nweight by approximately 1 pound. An adjustment more \nthan one pound is not recommended unless the archer is \nin very good physical condition and even then an archer \nshould never increase more than 2 pounds at a time as it \ncould have detrimental affects on shooting technique and \npossibly induce an injury. Other gross adjustments that \nwill improve the spine compatibility of an arrow that is \ntoo stiff are an increase in arrow point weight and a reduc-\ntion in the number of strands in the string (reducing the \nphysical weight of the bowstring). In the same relation, \na decrease in the weight of the centre serving material or \na decrease in the length of the centre serving will have a \nsimilar effect as well as a reduction in the weight of the \nnocking point (example: changing from a metal nocking \npoint to a tie-on type).\nIf the unfletched shafts impact right of the identically \naimed fletched shafts (weak), (for a right-handed archer, \nopposite (stiff ) for a left hand archer), decrease bow \nweight slightly (if your bow weight is adjustable) and or \ndecrease arrow point weight. Here, the bow weight would \nbe your best adjustment to move the bare shafts into or \nnear the same group as the fletched shafts. Going down \nin bow weight is not a problem other than losing a little \narrow speed. Y our equipment is basically tuned when \nthe bare shafts and fletched shafts impact at the same or \nvery near the same location. Once you have completed \nthe Fine Tuning process do not be surprised if the bare \nshaft impact changes. It is common on a well-tuned bow \nto have the bare shafts impact a different location than \nthe fletched shafts. Usually, a good tune will have the bare \nshafts impacting close to the fletched shafts in the hori-\nzontal plane, but if the nocking point height is not correct \nthe bare shaft impact position may be slightly higher or \nlower than the fletched shafts impact position.\nCushion Plunger Setting\nWhen correcting fishtailing using the Bare Shaft Planing \nT est, use the cushion plunger for fine adjustments only and \nnot for large horizontal adjustments. It is important to first \nhave good spine compatibility for the bow before using the \ncushion plunger to correct gross errors in spine. In the fine \ntuning process, the cushion plunger’s ability for improving \ngrouping will become evident. Also, it is important to note \nthat when adjusting the cushion plunger tension, it will al-\nmost always affect nocking point height as well as dynamic \nspine. Don’t be surprised if the bare shaft impacts change in \nheight as well as horizontal impact.\nIf during the tuning process you are unable to get the \nunfletched shafts to impact near the fletched shafts in \nthe horizontal plane, it will most likely be necessary to \nchange arrow sizes. Your arrows might be too weak (the \nunfletched shaft impacts to the right of the fletched shaft \nfor right-handed archers) or too stiff (the unfletched \nshaft impacts to the left of the fletched shaft for right-\nhanded archers). If, after completing this test, the bare \nshaft impact is more than 3 inches (8 cm) to the right \n(weak) or left (stiff ) of the fletched shafts at 20 yards \n(18 m), you will most likely need to change shaft size. \nHowever, before going to this more costly investment, \nmake sure you are not having a false tuning indicator \ncaused by a clearance problem. Usually, incompatible \narrow spine is the biggest cause of a clearance problem, \nbut not always.\nClearance\nT o check for clearance, use dry powder foot spray, dry \ndeodorant spray or similar product applied to the last \nquarter of the arrow shaft, fletching, arrow rest assembly \nand sight window near the arrow rest. Do not disturb the \npowder sprayed on the arrow and bow while preparing to \nshoot. The arrow should be shot into a firm target so that \nit will not penetrate to the powder area. Then check the \npowder on the arrow to see if there are any marks indicat-\ning an impact between the arrow and bow.\nCorrecting Clearance Problems\nIf you are not achieving good arrow clearance, and the ar-\nrow fletching and bow make contact, optimum grouping \ncannot be achieved. By examining the areas where the dry \npowder spray is scraped off, the nature of any interference \ncan be determined, and the position of the fletching as the \narrow leaves the bow can be identified. If there is a clear -\nance problem, this can usually be seen in the arrows flight \nto the target. A term used to explain the visual flight distur-\nbance is called Minnowing. Like fishtailing or Porpoising, \nMinnowing describes a specific arrow flight disturbance. \nMinnowing will appear to look much like fishtailing ex -\ncept that the tail of the arrow appears to move from side to \nside more quickly, and the amount of side swing is usually \nmuch less than in fishtailing. See Figure 19.\nFigure 19."}

What follows here is infor-\nmation that will help you perform the fine tuning adjust -\nments necessary to eliminate most or all of the minute \ntuning problems.\nMany archers have experienced one or all of the fol-\nlowing arrow grouping/arrow flight combinations: poor \narrow flight and good grouping. This is commonly the \nresult of a stiff arrow. The arrow yaws slightly as it leaves \nthe bow, but usually recovers quickly and often produces \nvery acceptable grouping.\nGood arrow flight and poor grouping. Although this \nseems contradictory, the phenomenon is somewhat com-\nmon and relates to the tuning method used, or a lack of \nfine tuning. Having perfect arrow flight, or having the \nbare shafts impact exactly with the fletched shafts using \nthe Bare Shaft Planing T est, does not always mean your \narrows will group well; it only means the arrows fly well. \nThe section on Fine Tuning will assist you in obtaining \noptimal grouping from your equipment as well as good \narrow flight. It is best to work toward good arrow flight \nand good grouping as this will produce the most consist -\nent results in any weather and especially windy condi-\ntions.\nArrow grouping patterns often reveal probable arrow \nflight problems. Two of the most common grouping in-\ndicators for determining arrow flight problems are de-\nscribed below.\nExcessive Drag\nIf the arrow has too much drag, that is the fletchings are \ntoo large or the fletch are off-set too much, it can cause \nexcessive drag and grouping will often suffer at long dis -\ntance. For example, if shooting FITA distances of 90, 70, \n50 and 30 meters for men and 70, 60, 50 and 30 meters \nfor women, you may experience good grouping on all \ndistances except for the longest distance. If this is the \ncase, the arrow most likely has too much drag. Exces -\nsive drag will cause the arrow to become unstable due \nto the rapid decay of its forward velocity. When forward \nvelocity drops too quickly, instability occurs. This un-\nstable flight causes poor grouping at long distances and \nextreme vulnerability to wind drift. On lightweight ar -\nrows, it is very important to reduce drag to a minimum \nto maintain maximum downrange velocity. This can be \ndone by reducing the size (height and/or length) of the \nfletching or by reducing the angle of the fletching, or \nboth.\nInsufficient Clearance\nA clearance problem will usually have the opposite effect \nof excessive drag. Most often arrow grouping is accept -\nable at longer distances, however, the shorter distance \ngroups are not reduced in size proportionately to those \nat the longer distances. This situation commonly results \nin short distance scores that are significantly less than \nwhat the longer distance scores would indicate. If this is \na familiar scenario, look for a clearance problem or micro \ndisturbance within the bow and arrow system. T o correct, \nsee the section on Clearance.\nAdjusting the Bow and Arrow System\nIf you are having problems tuning your bow, you will \nneed to make some modifications to your equipment to \nachieve a better tune. Here are some suggestions:"}
{"id": "Coaching_Manual_Level2-0171", "source": "Coaching_Manual_Level2.pdf", "chunk_index": 170, "page_start": 184, "page_end": 184, "text": "FITA Coaching Manual Intermediate Level14\nBow Weight Adjustment\nVirtually all target quality recurve bows have an adjust -\nable draw weight system. Bow weight adjustment should \nbe the first tuning consideration if your arrow reaction is \nsignificantly stiff or weak. It is important not to increase \nbow weight more than one to two pounds as it could have \ndetrimental effect on shooting technique. Here is a good \nguideline to follow to know if you can physically handle \nany increase in bow weight. Simply draw and hold your \nbow at full draw for 60 seconds. If it you can hold the \nweight for an entire minute, you can handle the one to \ntwo pound increase. If the arrow reaction is too stiff when \napplying the bare shaft tuning test, increase the draw \nweight. If your arrow reaction is too weak, decrease the \ndraw weight.\nBowstring\nBowstring “weight” can have a significant effect on arrow \nspine. Increasing or decreasing the number of strands in \nthe bowstring can influence the arrow’s dynamic spine \nenough to require a shaft size change of up to one full size \nweaker or stiffer. If your arrow reaction is too stiff, decrease \nthe number of strands in your bowstring. If your arrow re-\naction is too weak, increase the number of strands. Serv -\ning weight (centre serving) can also produce the same ef-\nfect. For example, monofilament centre serving will cause \nthe arrow to react stiffer than lighter weight nylon centre \nserving. Simply changing from a metal nocking point to \na “tie-on” nocking point can have a noticeable effect on \narrow spine as well due to the weight difference between \nthe two styles of nocking points.\nPoint and Insert Weight\nThe arrows dynamic spine can be tuned by using various \npoint and/or insert/outsert weight combinations. If your \narrow is too weak, go to a lighter insert or point. If your \narrow is too stiff, try a heavier insert or point. Continue to \nchange insert and/or point weights within an acceptable \nbalance point range (10–18% F.O.C.).\nDocumenting Equipment\nOnce you have completed the Bare shaft Planing T est and \nbefore starting the fine tuning process, it is important to \nwrite down the exact measurements of your bow. Having \nall of the equipment information documented will allow \nyou to return to the initial settings if something strange \nhappens during the fine tuning process. When your bow \nand arrow are fully compatible and optimum arrow flight \nand grouping have been achieved, then you will want to \nre-document the equipment for future reference.\nFollowing is most of the information that should be \nincluded in the documentation.\na. Nocking point height.\nb. Brace height.\nc. Tiller.\nd. Number of strands in the bowstring and type of mate-\nrial.\ne. Type of centre serving and end serving.\nf. Bow string weight (use a grain scale).\ng. Weight of bow at full draw weight.\nh. Type of stabilizers used, length, amount of weight on \neach rod etc.\nIn other words, everything you can think of to document \nyour equipment.\nNext, number all of your arrows. This enables you to plot \ngroups and to plot each individual arrow. This process is \nvery important in discovering which arrows group con-\nsistently and those that don’t. Another good trick is to \nplace a small “dot” on one fletch each time that arrow hits \nthe “10” ring (best to do this only for the longer distanc-\nes). Pretty soon, it is clear what arrows you will want to \nuse in competition….. the ones with the most dots!\nWhen you are ready to start the fine tuning process, \nuse a new 40 cm target face and use it as the “plotting” tar-\nget. This will allow you to record each arrow impact and \nthe number of that arrow to determine common impact \npoints for each arrow in the bunch.\nPrepare to shoot from a distance you are most com-• \nfortable with from 40 to 70 yards or meters, on a face \nsize you are comfortable with, and depending on your \nskill level.\nShoot an end or two to warm up before starting the • \nplotting process.\nAfter warming up, shoot a group of 6 to 10 fletched • \narrows.\nWrite down the number of each arrow and the impact • \npoint on the sample “plotting” target.\nShoot at least two groups before making any adjust -• \nments. Remember to make only one adjustment at a \ntime. When making a tuning adjustment, use a differ -\nent coloured pen for each time an adjustment is made \nor use another plotting target so the results are not \nconfused."}
{"id": "Coaching_Manual_Level2-0172", "source": "Coaching_Manual_Level2.pdf", "chunk_index": 171, "page_start": 185, "page_end": 185, "text": "Recurve Bow Equipment Tuning 15\nExamine the groups for patterns to see if the group is • \nmore vertical than horizontal, more horizontal than \nvertical or if there is not discernable pattern.\nReading the Plotted Arrow Groups\nCarefully examine the arrow grouping patterns you plot -\nted. Note the different shapes of the groups and how \nthe adjustments altered the arrow impact and size of the \ngroups. Examine each arrow by its number. T ake careful \nnote of any arrows that did not group consistently with \nthe other shafts. Monitor these shafts to see if they are \nconsistently out of the group as you will probably want \nto mark these shafts so you will know not to use them in \ncompetition.\nVertical grouping patterns\nIf the groups are more vertical than horizontal, adjust the \nnocking point 1/32˝ (.8 mm) either up or down. Shoot an-\nother two groups and plot the arrows in the same man-\nner as described above. For future reference, be sure to \nwrite down your bow adjustment on each arrow group \nyou plot. Measure the distance between the high and low \narrow to determine an average between the groups. This \nwill help to identify if the high and low arrow impact has \nimproved or not in the next grouping sequence. If it has \nimproved, make another adjustment of 1/32˝ (.8 mm) in \nthe same direction and shoot another two ends. If the \nhigh and low arrow impact is better, continue in that di-\nrection until you achieve the most consistent group eleva-\ntion. Obviously if the vertical impacts are worse, go back \nto the original setting and make the same adjustment in \nthe opposite direction.\nHorizontal grouping patterns\nWhile tuning, remember to continue the documenting \nprocess on each plotted arrow group for the one tuning \nvariable that was changed. For horizontal adjustments it \nis best to adjust only the cushion plunger spring tension, \nnot the in/out position of the cushion plunger. Make \nadjustments to the cushion plunger spring tension in 1/8 \nturn increments only. Shoot two groups and measure the \nfarthest left and right arrows (eliminating arrows where \nknown mistakes were made in the technique). Make the \nfirst spring tension adjustment either stiffer or weaker \nand shoot two more ends. Again, if the group becomes \nwider, go back to the original setting and make an adjust-\nment of 1/8 turn in the opposite direction. Compare the \ngroups you just shot and determine if they are getting \nbetter or worse. If the groups improved, make another \nadjustment of 1/8 turn in the same direction and shoot \nanother two ends. Continue this process until you have \nachieved the tightest possible grouping in the horizontal \nplane at that distance. If the groups do not change, con-\ntinue following this procedure until the groups improve \nor become wider. At the point where the groups just start \nto get wider, go back 1/8 turn to the previous setting and \nmake a small nocking point adjustment. Remember, ad-\njustments to the cushion plunger will often have some \neffect on the nocking point and it may be necessary to \nmake small adjustments to the nocking point during the \ncushion plunger adjustments. Here is where you should \nsee some significant group changes (hopefully much bet-\nter). Remember to make only one adjustment at a time. If \nthe groups become worse, go back to the original nocking \npoint setting and make the same adjustment in the oppo-\nsite direction to compare. Continue this process until the \nbest possible groups have been achieved with this single \nadjustment. Then, start making 1/8 turn spring tension ad-\njustments to see what happens to the grouping patterns. \nObviously if the groups are consistently GREAT , stop \nand re-document all the settings.\nThe fine tuning process is a dynamic relationship be-\ntween the nocking point height and the cushion plunger \nspring tension. Any change to one affects the other and it \nis important to understand this relationship. When mak -\ning only one adjustment at a time, you will find the abil-\nity to continually “compress” the up/down and left/right \ngrouping patterns into the best possible grouping your \nskill level is capable of. After completing this procedure, \nyou should find a combination of adjustments that will \neither slightly or significantly improve arrow grouping.\nOnce you have completed the long distance tuning, \nmove to 20 yards (18 m) and see if the bow continues to \ngroup well here too. It should, but if not look for a clear -\nance problem. By shooting all your competition distanc-\nes at the end of the fine tuning, you will have confidence \nin knowing that your equipment can perform well at any \ndistance when shooting competition.\nFine tuning the brace height\nFinding the correct brace height for your bow can, in \nmany cases, greatly improve consistency and grouping \nand should be considered as a fine-tuning adjustment.\nThe chart below shows the maximum range of brace \nheight for most modern recurve bows. However, these \nare extreme at the high and low end of the range and"}

Changes within the brace height \nranges shown can affect arrow spine as much as chang-\ning the arrow point and/or insert weight approximately \n20 grains. Remember, it is best to shoot your bow at its \nsmoothest and quietest setting. The chart below shows \na range wide enough to create a “between” size arrow \nspine.\nMaximum Recommended Brace Height Range for \nMost Competition Recurve Bows (by bow length)\n64˝- 7 3/4˝ to 9˝ (19.7 cm to 22.9 cm)\n66˝- 8˝ to 9 1/4˝ (20.3 cm to 23.5 cm)\n68˝- 81/4˝ to 9 1/2˝ (21.0 cm to 24.1 cm)\n70˝- 81/2˝ to 9 3/4˝ (21.6 cm to 24.8 cm)\nBrace height is a fine tuning adjustment and should be \ndone in small increments. When working through the \nfine tuning process, try making a small brace height ad-\njustment to see how it affects grouping. If the string has \nvery few twists, it will take more turns to achieve a spe-\ncific change than if the string has numerous twists. Make \nadjustments in very small increments of 1/16˝ at a time \nand see how the groups are affected and note any changes \nin the sound and feel of the bow. If the string has many \ntwists, it will take only one or two turns to achieve the \n1/16˝ brace height change. If the string has very few twists, \nit may take 3 or more twists to achieve the same result.\nIdentifying Specific Arrow Problems\nY ou may find an arrow that does not group well with the \nother arrows in the set. Examine it before you discard that \narrow or retire it from competition. Sometimes a prob -\nlem is easily identified and other problems are not so evi-\ndent. If a shaft is cracked or dented it should be discarded. \nSome arrows may seem fine, but they may have problems \nthat are not obvious and can cause the arrows to group \npoorly. The following list identifies common arrow prob-\nlems, which may cause inconsistent or a stray impact.\nArrow Straightness\nArrows must be straight for tight grouping. Straightness \nshould be within 0.004˝ or better for best grouping. This \nalso depends where the bend is located. A slight bend \nnear the nock end of the shaft may cause a greater impact \nvariation than a larger bent that is over the full length of \nthe shaft.\nCrooked Nocks\nThere are several ways to check nock straightness, includ-\ning commercially available nock gauges and special ar -\nrow spinning wheels. Make sure the nocks are absolutely \nstraight. Crooked nocks can cause severe accuracy prob -\nlems.\nNock Indexing\nIt is possible that one nock in the set may be turned more \nthan the others. A clearance problem results if the nock \nis rotated too far, forcing the fletching into the arrow rest \nor cushion plunger when shot. Make sure all nocks are \nindexed the same and that the spacing between the two \n“clearance fletches” (the two vanes that clear past the ar -\nrow rest and cushion plunger) is the same. When fletch-\ning, it is common for some fletch to be spaced closer \ntogether than others on the shaft. Always choose the \ntwo vanes that are furthest apart to use as the clearance \nfletch.\nLoose or Damaged Fletching\nFletching that is slightly damaged will not usually affect \narrow grouping, but if the fletching becomes even slightly \ndetached from the shaft, the arrow will not group with \nthe others. The arrow may not even hit the target past 30 \nyards (meters). In the case of hard plastic vanes, if the rear \nof any vane is bent, it will also cause a change in impact.\nLoose Points/Inserts\nMany archers are not aware of this potential problem. \nPoints must be properly installed with good hot melt ad-\nhesive or epoxy, depending on the shaft material. Care-\nfully follow the instructions on point/insert installation \nfrom the arrow manufacturer. Some brands of hot melt \nare often brittle and may fracture when the arrow impacts \nhard target butt materials. If the cement fractures or the \npoint is improperly installed, it can result in a separation \nbetween the point/insert and the shaft. When separation \noccurs and the arrow is shot, the separation of the bond \nbetween the shaft and point can cause the point to vibrate \nagainst the shaft wall affecting the arrow’s natural fre-\nquency of vibration and arrow accuracy. T o test for point \nvibration, hold the arrow a few inches below the fletching \nand lightly tap the point on carpet or grass. If you hear a \nbuzzing sound, the point/insert is probably loose. Heat \nand pull out the point/insert and properly reinstall., Y ou"}

If you have arrows \nthat consistently impact a little high or low of your group \nit may be due to a slight weight variation. A matched set \nof arrows should have no more than a three grain spread \nbetween the heaviest and lightest arrows in the set.

With this practice no change will occur in the \nshoulder position at the time of extending and a clean re-\nlease can be produced.\nIn case archers exceed more than 30 degrees the body \nweight is slanting forward and so the balance of pow-\ner over the two feet becomes unsatisfactory, When the \ntwisting of waist is too strong, the flexibility of the body \ncomes to disappear and archers come to feel tension in \nthe upper body.\nAlso movement takes place in the waist causing the \nbow shoulder and arm to shake making it impossible to \nproduce a good shot.\nThe open stance, if done correctly can have an advan-\ntage in which the archer can have a feeling of stability in \nwindy conditions.\n2.

In this way an archer comes \nto maintain the height of the elbow when drawing a bow. \nThis will also help to make the bow seem easier pull as \nthe draw travels in the lower direction from the slightly \nhigher original position. This will help to maintain the \nalignment of the arm drawing the bow, the arrow and the \nelbow, and keep a horizontal draw force line.\nMaintaining the correct centre of gravity of the body \nat the time of the setup\nWhen drawing a bow the archer should place the centre \nof gravity of the body over the centre of both legs i.e. if \nthe centre line of the body was continued down to the \nground this line would fall directly central to the position \nwhere the feet are placed on the ground.\nNote: Some Coaches recommend getting the Centre \nof Gravity a little towards the toes, either by canting the \nentire body frontward or by canting the top body from \nhips.\nIf this centre line is not positioned correctly a change \nwill occur to this line when the archer draws the bow.\nMaintaining the correct angle of the body at the time \nof the setup\nWhen drawing a bow the archer should place the centre \nof gravity of the upper body at the centre of both legs, i.e. \nat the centre of gravity of the whole body.

If the relationship between the up -\nper body and hips changes at this time it will effect many \nareas during the draw, or even, when at full draw. The \narcher’s body position goes through many changes when \ncoming to full draw and it is imperative to keep these to \na minimum.\nHooking (Placing the fingers on the string)\nHooking (placing the fingers on the string) is an action \nthat should be undertaken carefully and correctly. The \nfinger tab should be correctly placed on the fingers and \nthe string should be correctly positioned on the finger \ntab. If this is not done correctly many inconsistencies in \nthe archers stance, including full draw and extending etc. \ncan be affected and depend on the position in which the \nfingers and tab are placed on the string.

There will be a small difference in the position when \nthe string is placed on the fingers; this is dependant on \nthe length of the fingers of each individual archer.\n8. An archer should choose a finger tab which is most \nsuitable for the size and form of their fingers and \nwhich is comfortable to wear.\n9. The direction of force at full draw should be in a \nstraight line – from the tip of the drawing arm elbow, \nthrough the wrist and fingers on the string to the pres-\nsure point on the bow, this is known as the draw force \nline (DFL).\n10. No tension should enter the thumb or little finger and \nthey should remain relaxed at all times.\nThe position in which a string is placed on the fingers\nThe position where the string is placed on the fingers may \nwell be on the first joint of the fingers. The prepared posi-\ntion of the fingers on the string prior to drawing the string \nmay be well behind the first joint but when the drawing \nhand reaches the anchor (draw reference point) the string \nmay now be in the first joint on the fingers. T o achieve \nthis string location at full draw it may be necessary, while \nat the prepared position, to position the string a little fur-\nther down the fingers than the first joint.\nThe distribution of the force on the fingers\nThe distribution of the force of the three fingers placed \non the string should be naturally implemented. It will be \nvery strenuous to consciously distribute this force and it \nwill be difficult to effect natural release. Various inconsist-\nencies within the stance can be caused by inconsistencies \nin the placement of the fingers on the string; this is caused \nby the change in force which is applied to the fingers that \nhas taken place. If an archer masters the stance the distri-\nbution of force on the fingers will be realized naturally.\nThe elbow of the drawing arm and the height of the \narrow\nIf the elbow of the drawing arm rises too high above the \nline of the arrow, the optimum line is just above the line \nof the arrow, the force on the fingers is inclined toward \nthe ring finger (third finger). In the case of the elbow be-\ning inclined downward, lower than the arrow line, the \nforce will fall onto the middle and third finger. The cor -\nrect height of the drawing elbow is essential and will be \nhelpful in producing the correct distribution of force on \nthe fingers.\nPlacing the string on the drawing hand fingers\nIf the string is positioned too far along the fingers the \nforce comes to be directed toward the ring finger, which \nforces the ring finger to press strongly on the string. This \naction makes it difficult to execute a clean release.\nIf the string is placed here it is too far along the fingers."}

On \naverage, slightly more force is applied to the middle fin-\nger; the next is the ring (third) finger and then the index \nfinger.\nThe joints of the fingers and wrist\nIf tension is applied to the joints of the fingers and/or \nwrist stopping them from being relaxed and in a natural \nline, the force line of drawing the string does not reach the \nback muscles which restricts the action of extending the \nbody into the shot. Also, if the tension is excessive in the \nfingers and wrist the distribution of force is not even and \nthe direction of force cannot be accurately performed.\nT oo tensed string hand.\nThe direction of the force on the fingers\nThe direction of force on the fingers from the time of \ndrawing the string to the process of releasing is very im-\nportant. The muscle tension required to keep the fingers \nof the drawing hand on the string should be just sufficient \nto maintain control of the string. The position and action \nof the elbow has a direct bearing on the action, and reac-\ntion, of the bow. If when at full draw the string is too far \ndown the fingers all the force is focused on the fingers, \nand; If too much tension is used it will be difficult to ex -\necute a clean release.\nThe use of a finger tab\nThe finger tab can significantly affect an archer’s perform-\nance, this all depends on the quality, the material and \nform, and they all can affect the archer’s control. There \nhave been cases where fingers have been injured because \nof an ill fitting or damaged finger tab. The material of \nfinger tabs should be consistent and efficient, even if it \nis used for a long time. The archer should also choose a \nmaterial that does not change in quality during inclement \nweather. Also, if the archer uses a multi layer tab it can \nhelp to reduce the possibility of injury to the fingers.\nPlacing the drawing fingers on the string\nThe fingers drawing the string should not put undue \nprssure onto the nock of the arrow. The middle finger \nshould not touch or raise the nock as this would force the \nnock into a false position and cause inconsistencies in the \narrow pattern on the target. The top finger should softly \ntouch the top of the nock when the archer has come to \nthe full draw and reached the anchor point (Draw refer -\nence point).\n4. The Grip (hand position on the bow)\nThe position of the grip is the most central position of a \nbow; this and the hand pressure on it exerts a great deal of \neffect on the direction in which the bow moves at the time \nof the shot. The entire force of a bow, i.e. the upward and \ndownward balance, is in accordance with the direction of \nforce and the position of the bow hand and its contact \nwith the bow grip. In particular, as a clicker (draw length \ncheck) is introduced, a lot of changes occur in the direc-\ntion of force at the time of extending the draw force line \nto complete the shot. Therefore, an archer should master \nthe accurate hand position on the bow grip which is com-\npatible with their physique and stance."}

The hand position on the bow grip should become a \nconstant and natural position for every shot.\n2. The direction of force of the hand pushing the bow \ngrip should not be biased up, down or left or right but \ndirectly forward and on the centre of the bow grip.\n3. The archer should feel a natural and comfortable hand \nposition on the bow grip, they should also feel, and \nkeep, the stability in the shoulder bow and arm as the \nbody is extended to complete the shot.\n4. There should be little or no force exerted on, or by, the \nfingers of the bow hand as the pressure is increased on \nthe bow grip to complete the shot.\n5. There should be no change in the direction of the force \non the bow grip at the time of extending.\n6. The hand position on the bow grip should not slip to \neither the left or right at the time of extending.\n7. The fingers of the bow hand, once set, should not \nmove during the time of extending.\nThe height of the bow grip\nThe height of the bow grip can differ from bow manu-\nfacturer to bow manufacturer or from model to model. \nTherefore, archers should choose a height of bow grip \nthat suits their hand, bone structure and shooting form. \nWhilst the archer draws the bow and the hand pressure \nincreases on the bow grip the force of the hand should be \nin the lateral centre of the bow grip and at place lower than \nthe vertical centre of the bow grip. At this time, the direc-\ntion of force should not move up or be inclined to the left \nor right. Whilst in the early stages it may be worthwhile \nplacing/attaching something to the bow grip to help the \narcher locate a constant position for their hand, it should \nbe positioned to suit their individual style.\nThe position and condition of a stabilized bow hand\n1 The archer should be able to feel the most comfortable \nhand position when they draw their bow.\n2. The archer should feel and sense the central part of the \nhand as it contacts the central part of the bow grip.\n3. There should be no force exerted on the wrist which \njeopardises the bow hand position on the bow grip\n4. When the archer draws a bow they should have a natu-\nral sense of feeling with the bow hand and shoulder \nline.\nThe form of the fingers of the bow hand\nArchers should let the thumb and forefinger bend in a \nway that is natural to them. If archers unfold their thumb \nand forefinger the muscles of the centre of the fingers be-\ncome unnatural and unwanted force may be introduced \nto the wrist. It also is advisable for all the other fingers to \nbe relaxed and maintain a natural state whilst executing \nthe shot.\nThe direction of hand pressure on the bow grip\nA great variety of changes can take place, many of which \nare dependant on the direction of pressure the bow hand \nexerts on the bow grip. The direction of this pressure \ninfluences the right and left position of an arrow when \naimed at the target. The consistency of this pressure loca-\ntion is very important because even a small change can \nhave an effect, it may even cause changes occur to, the \nDFL (draw force line) i.e. the bow grip, bow arm, the ar -\nrow, and drawing arm.\n1. The direction of the force should be placed between \nthe thumb and forefinger and this central part should \nbe placed in the centre of the grip of the bow.\n2. The hand being placed on the centre of the bow grip \nshould be placed there gently and in precisely the same \nposition each time.\n3. The thumb and forefinger of the bow hand find their \nown position naturally which is usually directed \nslightly inward. At this time, the thumb and forefinger"}

The division of force on the thumb \nand finger should be equal at 50%.\nThe palm on the bow grip\nThe left part of the palm (A) on the bow hand should \nnot touch the grip part of the bow. The palm should \nface the ground. In situations where the palm becomes \nvertical i.e. the same plane as the bow, archers cannot \nturn the bow arm inward which results in the arm and \nshoulder not being located correctly, and it is difficult to \nachieve a good angle in the full draw position. With the \ndirection of the hand located on the grip being inclined \nto the left, it forces the centre line of the body to be in-\nclined backward.\nThe centre of the bow grip should always be the push-\ning pressure contact point. If the Bow hand slides up the \ngrip during the draw the bone of the palm (B) becomes \nthe pushing pressure contact point. As this is lower than \nthe centre of the grip undesirable changes to the archers \nform and movement of the bow will occur at the time \nof shooting.\nThe use of a bow sling\nGetting a beginner to use a bow sling is very important. \nIf a beginner does not use a bow sling they become \nto develop the habit of holding the bow with the bow \nhand. This is not a good habit and should be discour -\naged. When the beginner takes hold of a bow unwanted \nforces are introduced into the muscles and they start to \nenergise, when this happens movement occurs in the \nbow arm. Therefore, from the outset, a beginner should \nuse a bow sling so that they can maintain the direction \nof force which pushes on the central part of the bow grip \nwith the bow hand.\nKinds of bow sling\nThere are various kinds of bow slings; however, we give \nthe preference to the finger sling. The reason is that \nwhen using a wrist sling the bow movement can be ex -\ncessive, and the bow moves up and down, and right and \nleft at the time of shooting. However, when a finger sling \nis being used the grip pushing a bow can face the centre \nof a target, and the archer can have a feeling in which the \nbow and bow arm extend freely toward the target at the \nmoment of the shot. The finger sling should be placed \nbetween the forefinger and the thumb. If the archer \nplaces the finger sling between a middle finger and the \nthumb the direction of the face of the palm on the bow \nhand changes at the time of shooting, this would cause a \nchange in the direction of the force of the pushing bow \narm."}

Full Draw\nHaving a good body position at full draw is the most impor-\ntant element of making a good shot. The angles of the body \ncan vary in accordance with many physical characteristics \nof the archer. Therefore, there can be minor differences in \nthe basic techniques in accordance with each archer’s phy-\nsique when taking up the correct angle when at full draw. \nThe stance when at full draw is very important as it is the \nfinal stance before loosing the arrow. After the archer has \nmastered adopting the correct stance at full draw the archer \nshould begin to train and perfect the release.\n7.1 The correct body stance at full draw\nWhen at full draw it is important to stand erect and that \nthe body is straight.\nIf the body is leaning or bent at this time, as in the picture \nbelow, the pushing arm shoulder will have a tendency to \nrise. In such a case the pushing arm, arrow and drawing \narm will not be in a vertical line but will lean at a similar \nangle to that which the body has adopted.\n7.2 The full draw position as seen from the front\nThe centre of the grip of the bow hand, the position of the \nanchored hand and the elbow of the drawing arm should \nall be in a straight line. The elbow of the drawing arm \nshould be at a higher plane than the line of the arrow, and \nthe shoulder of the pushing arm should be lower than the \nline of the arrow. If at this time the shoulder of the push-\ning arm is higher than the line of the arrow it will be dif -\nficult to use back tension, and the shoulder will continue \nto rise during the extending phase."}

It is important to have a straight line from the \ngrip of the pushing arm through the fingers of the draw -\ning hand to the elbow of the drawing arm. At this time \nthough, it will be acceptable for the drawing arm elbow \nto be positioned a little behind straight drawing line. The \nupper body should be central and vertical to the stance, if \nit is not positioned in this way the centre of gravity of the \nbody will move at the time of extending causing incon-\nsistencies to the shot.\n7.4 The position of full draw as seen from behind.\nThe drawing shoulder blade should be lower that the \npushing shoulder blade at the time of full draw, see picture \nbelow. The shoulder of the pushing arm should maintain \nthe pushing state while the drawing shoulder continues \na strong drawing action. Performing this action will de-\nvelop the correct balance and back tension, and develop a \ngood release at the time of extending.\n7.5 The inclining of the bow at full draw.\nAt the time of full draw the bow should be vertical and not \ncanted left or right. The position of the string and the di-\nrection of arrow flight will be different if the bow is canted \nat the time of aiming and loosing. This is usually caused \nby the upper body leaning one way or the other taking the \nbow to a similar angle to that the body has taken up, so \nspecial attention is needed to ensure the stance and body \nposition is correct before completing the shot.\n7.6 The inclining of the body at full draw.\nIf the centre line of the body is leaning or inclined at the \ntime of full draw, the archer will have difficulty in effect -\ning a perfect shot.

The archer should also be cau-\ntious at this time and not let the arrow pass through \nthe clicker until they are totally ready.\nWhilst maintaining the sight pin on the centre of the • \ntarget the archer should be extending continuously.\nWhen the arrow point activates the clicker the archer • \ncommences the release, this should not be delayed but \nshould be completed in a natural and relaxed action.\nStrong points: The archer comes to full draw being aware \nof the arrow point and clicker relationship. In particular \nthey see the arrow point nearing the position of activating \nthe clicker which develops a fixed draw length and helps \nproducing a constant extending time.\nWeak points: When the archer comes to full draw and \ntheir vision moves from the arrow point to the sight pin, \na phenomenon occurs where full draw pressure is relaxed \nand the arrow creeps slightly forward. T o counter this, the \narcher must actively continue the extending action in a \ncontinuous motion.\n8.2.2 The method of drawing the bow without look-\ning at the arrow.\nThe archer should select the correct length arrow before \nusing this method. T o determine this, the archer should \nclose the eyes and come to full draw; the arrow length can \nthen be measured when the archer is extending comfort -\nably. This should be practiced several times to ensure the \ncorrect arrow length is obtained."}

When the archer has mastered \nthis method and the draw length becomes constant, as a \nnext step, it will be more effective to select the method of \nusing a clicker without looking at the arrow point.\n8.2.4 In the case of young archers, and depending on \ntheir age and height, their draw length should be checked \nregularly, possibly every 3 to 6 months. Their height, arm \nlength and shoulder width may all change at differing \ntimes but they can all have a bearing on their draw length. \nTheir arrows should be kept long to allow for this change \nin their physique and possible draw length.\n8.3 The balance of extending\nProducing a good balance of power at the time of extend-\ning is a very important archers’ skill.\nThe distribution of the power of pushing, and draw -\ning, should always be constant. In the case of beginners, \nit is good to produce a ratio of 50% pushing and 50% \ndrawing. Depending on the individual archer there will \nbe a small difference in the distribution of this power; \nhowever, it is important that no matter how small this \ndifference is it should remain constant. Care should be \ntaken that the distribution of power at the time of ex -\ntending remains constant, even if the time of extending \nvaries. This is because the distribution of power is con-\nstant when the extending time is short, but the balance \nof power may change when the extending time becomes \na little long.\n8.4 The direction of extending\nThe direction of extending should remain constant at all \ntimes. The pushing arm should correctly push from the \npivot point of the arm, and the elbow of the drawing arm \nshould maintain a direct line of movement in the oppo -\nsite direction.\n8.5 The areas to be cautious of at the time of extend-\ning\nAn archer should not execute the extending action by • \nusing the fingers\nt\nNo change should take place in the position of the an-• \nchor at the time of extending.\nAll fingers should stay on the tab and not slip off at the • \ntime of extending.\nThe drawing elbow should not be lowered at the time • \nof extending.\nThe shoulder of the pushing arm should not move up-• \nward at the time of extending.\nThe pushing hand on the bow grip should not move • \nto the left or right at the time of extending."}

The release\nIt is essential that the archer develops and masters the re-\nlease either in the beginning or intermediate stage of their \ntraining, as it is very difficult to correct the release later. In \nparticular it is essential that the archer masters the release \nbefore using a clicker as they can concentrate on, and \nmaster, the release before having to control the clicker \nas well. However, once the archer begins to use a clicker \nthey tend to concentrate on this and neglect the action \nand motion of the release. This sometimes gives rise to \nthe archer making a false release by consciously opening \nof the fingers. The release should be natural and follow \nthe line of power that the archer developed before being \nintroduced to the clicker. The position where the release \nbegins should be at the end of the action of coming to \nfull draw and at the beginning of when the extending ac-\ntion is being performed. If there is any deviation from this \nplace where the release begins errors will be introduced \ninto the performance of the shot, and the inconsistencies \nintroduced will degrade the efficiency of the shot.\n9.1 The direction of the release\nThe direction of the release should follow the line from \nthe back of the arrow and along the power line which is \njust under and along the jaw bone. If at the moment of re-\nlease the fingers deviate from this line, either into or away \nfrom the jaw, the fingers will leave the string in a false lo -\ncation forcing the arrow to deviate from the correct line \nof flight.\n9.2 The speed of release\nThe speed of the fingers releasing the string is very impor-\ntant. The relationship of time when the clicker falls from \nthe arrow point to the moment of the release is also very \nimportant. It is found that if there is a delay this is the \nmoment where most of the mistakes take place. It is im-\nportant that the release is perfected so that the time and \nspeed of the release stay uniform and constant.\n9.3 The distance of finger travel during the release\nThe distance of finger travel during the release should al-\nways be constant. It is not necessary for the distance of \ntravel to be any further than from the position of the fin-\ngers at the anchor (draw reference point) to just below \nthe ear. If the distance of travel is too short it is possible \nfor the releasing hand fingers to be drawn forward pro -\nducing a forward loose, and if the travel is too far it can \nproduce a sudden unwanted body movement.\n9.4 The use of the back muscles at the time of the re-\nlease\nThe archer should have a controlled release at the time \nof extending while maintaining the power and pressure \nacross the back muscles. In order to achieve a good re-\nlease, the power at the drawing arm elbow should be \nmaintained whilst the release is being performed. If ten-"}

It is important \nthat the muscle power controlling the fingers of the draw-\ning hand should just be relaxed at the time of the release, \nand the fingers should remain relaxed during the follow-\nthrough.\n9.6 The inspection of the finger tab\nArchers should regularly inspect the surface of the finger \ntab for wear; this is to ensure the release stays constant \nand efficient. This can also show the area of finger pres -\nsure on the tab and the line the string takes across it, and \nit can give an indication on the state the release. This will \nbe evident by the wear pattern – whether it is wearing \nevenly or partially in a particular area.\n10. Follow Through\nMaintaining the stance after the release is very important; \nnot only the stance, but also the form, the visual, mental \nand breathing activities. The archer’s mental preparation \nand thoughts of executing a good follow through will help \nin producing a good release, this has the added benefit of \nhelping to execute and perfect the process of extending.\n10.1 Maintaining the direction of power.\nDuring the process of release and follow through the \ndrawing hand should continue along the line of power \nthat was set-up during the extending procedure. This \nline is from the pressure point on the bow pushing hand, \nthrough the drawing hand fingers where they are located \non the string, to the point of the elbow of the drawing \narm.\n10.2 Maintaining the vertical centre line of the body\nDuring the action of the release and follow through the \narcher must maintain the vertical line of the body. If the \nbody deviates from this central line the body will shake \nat the time of release and unwanted movement will be \nintroduced.\n10.3 Sustaining the use of the back muscles.\nThe muscles of the back should not be relaxed rapidly at \nthe time of the release. Errors during the completion of \nthe shot may occur but can be prevented when the back \nmuscles are able to continue their operation during the \nrelease and follow through. This will also help the archer \nto perform a good shot whilst in a stress situation.\n10.4 Maintaining an accurate balance\nAn archer should establish and maintain an accurate bal-\nance during the time of the release and completion of the \nshot. If this balance is not maintained it is likely that the \npushing arm will shake or the drawing hand becomes un-\nsteady and the shot being performed will not be fully ef -\nficient.\n11. Breathing\nBreathing\nThe best method of breathing when shooting a bow is the \narchers own natural pattern. However, it is the timing of \nbreathing in and of breathing out that has to be control-\nled. It is recommended to develop a breathing sequence \nto be applied in parallel of the technical (movement) se-\nquence and the visual sequence.\n \n11.1 Set\nThis is the time when the archer is going through their \npreparation routine for drawing the bow. During this \ntime the archer is breathing naturally and in their nor -\nmally way. However, during this time of the shot the \narcher may become tense, their pulse rate increases and \ntheir breathing becomes irregular. At this time the arch-\ner should endeavour to maintain their regular breathing \npattern.\n11.2 Setup\nThe archer should breathe in during the time of setup but \nslightly differently from their normal way of breathing. If"}

Therefore, the breathing \nshould be controlled by the abdomen–breathing at ap -\nproximately 70 to 80% capacity; this will leave the upper \nbody stable and unaffected by the breathing action.\n \n11.3 Drawing\nAt the time of setup the string would have been drawn to \napproximately 70 to 80% of the full travel, (this point can \nbe different for each individual archer and depends on \ntheir own shooting technique). At this point the archer \nbreathes out slowly while drawing the string the rest of \nthe way to the anchor point (draw reference point). By \nthe time the archer’s drawing hand reaches the anchor \npoint they should still have 20 to 30% of air left in the \nlungs.\n11.4 Anchor\nThe action of breathing is suspended while the archer is in \nthe anchoring position. This suspended state should con-\ntinue until the shot is completed although the respiratory \ntract should remain open. After the shot has been com-\npleted the archer should return to their normal breathing \npattern.\n12. Shooting in the wind\n12.1 The phenomenon that takes place when shooting \nin windy conditions.\n12.1.1 The changing location of the arrows landing in \nthe target.\nAs the wind intensity and pressure fluctuates the arrow \nflight and location it strikes the target will be different \nfrom a shot performed under calm conditions. Even \nthough the arrow pushed by the wind may hit the same \nlocation, the location the archer aimed the shot and the \nposition of their body will possibly be different from \nshot to shot. Even if the archer shoots each arrow with \nthe same intensity and power the aiming position will dif-\nfer from shot to shot. However, in windy conditions, it is \nimpossible to calculate mathematically where the aiming \npoint should be to have the arrow strike the centre of the \ntarget. Because the conditions, including the field of play, \nwill be different for each event the archer should select \nthe position for their aiming point by comprehensively \nanalysing the situation as each condition presents itself.\n12.1.2 The changes in the flight of an arrow.\nDuring windy conditions the flight of the arrow is differ -\nent to the flight of the arrow in calm conditions, and these \ndifferences need considering. Especially before the con-\ntest begins, this is when archers become very sensitive to \nthe conditions and possibly become doubtful about their \nown ability and uneasy psychologically. Archers should \nabandon the thought that only their arrows are affected \nby the wind, everybody’s arrows are affected by the wind. \nDuring windy conditions the arrow’s direction and flight \ncannot be fully predicted, and so the archer must gener -\nate the confidence that they can shoot good shots in the \nwind. The direction and balance of correct shooting, \nincluding the follow-through etc. will help guide the ar -\nrow to hit the desired location. There are times when an \narcher makes a mistake and the arrow, being pushed by \nthe wind, actually hits the centre of the target. Therefore, \nit is important not to be afraid of the wind but accept it \nand prepare for it.\n12.1.3 The effect the wind has on clothing.\nDuring windy conditions clothing can flutter, particularly \nthe sleeves; if this is excessive the sleeve may move into \nthe path of the string causing it, and the arrow, to deviate \nfrom its true path. When the windy conditions are exces-\nsive the clothing movement can be extreme and can emit \nfluttering sounds, and may cause the archer’s body to \neven shiver or tremble, so the archer should be cautious \nabout the choice of clothing and select the right clothes \nfor the right conditions, as is done when it is sunny, warm \nor raining.\n12.1.4 Making a change to the centre of the body. \nWhen the wind condition is extreme, a change occurs \nto the centre of gravity. This occurs because the body re-\nsists by leaning toward the wind no matter which way it \nis coming from. There are occasions when, the power or \ndirection of the wind may not be constant, and the centre \nline of the body shakes or continues to move in accord-\nance with the direction and power of the wind. As this \ncauses various problems including sighting or holding, \nthe archer could lower the centre of the body (the lower \nabdomen). Though, the archer should be careful when \ndoing this for the upper body (chest) may float upward at \nthe time of setup when preparing the stance."}

The direction of the bow arm.\nWhen the conditions are calm or the wind is not blowing, \nthe arm pushing the bow and the centre of the grip always \ncorresponds to the centre of the target. However, during \nwindy conditions, the deviation of moving the bow arm \nis not constant and is dependant on the intensity and \ndirection of the wind, along with, the archer’s ability to \nmaintain their form during these conditions. At this time \nthe location of the sight on the target could be floating \naround the red/gold area when the arrow activates the \nclicker, and the release is made when this movement is \ntaking place. This could cause the archer to make a mis -\ntake which would influence where the arrow lands in the \ntarget because the arm pushing the bow will resist in the \nopposite direction of the wind. The power of movement \ngradually changes in accordance with the power and di-\nrection of the wind causing a collapse in the balance of \nholding. The archer is influenced by this change of power \nand tends to modify their rhythm and balance to com-\npensate for the disturbance and a poor shot is often pro -\nduced. The archer being adsorbed in concentrating on \nthe arrow hitting the centre of the target, often ends up by \nthrowing the bow arm in an endeavour to force the arrow \nback on line.\n12.1.6 The change in holding time.\nAs the method of contest changes, and the time the arch-\ner has to shoot their arrows reduces, the whole time of the \nshot is reduced. This in turn reduces the time the archer \nhas for each element of setting up the shot, consequently \nthe extending time can be significantly reduced. In windy \nconditions the extending time naturally increases which \ncreates problems as it becomes difficult for the archer to \nexercise the release in their normal and confident man-\nner. What is most important is that the archer produces a \nshort and confident extending time after fully mastering \nthe ability of producing a stable platform.\nRemark 2 \nSeconds\n3 \nSeconds\n4 \nSeconds\n5 \nSeconds\n6 \nSeconds\n7 \nSeconds\nBefore \ncorrection Uneasy Stable Stable A little \nuneasy Uneasy Quite \nuneasy\nUrgent \nholding\nAfter \ncorrection Uneasy Stable Stable Stable Stable A little \nuneasy Uneasy\n12.1.7 The change of extending time.\nWhen the clicker is activated in accordance with the \narcher’s natural or favourite time their own left and right \nbalance is accurately accomplished. However, in windy \nconditions the bow arm and body shake, and the hold-\ning time, becomes extended and a change in the balance \nof extending occurs. This takes place because the archer \nactivates the clicker differently from their normal time in \norder to produce a fast release. Because of this occurrence \nthe equilibrium of the balance becomes uneven, the dis -\ntance of extending is reduced and the power of balance \ncollapses. Therefore, the best way to master shooting in \nthe wind, even if the extending time has increased, is for \nthe archer to continue to make sure the original balance \nis maintained.\n12.1.8 The decrease of physical power.\nWhen the archer tries to resist the wind, the holding \ntime becomes longer than the archer’s natural time, and \nthe degree of fatigue of the prime muscles increases. \nWhen this occurs the physical power is reduced and the \narcher feels tired. This tiredness will have a direct bear -\ning on the archer’s concentration which will be signifi-\ncantly reduced.\n12.1.9 Estimating the distance of “aiming off ” for the \npower of the current wind.\nDuring windy conditions the archer becomes apprehen-\nsive about where they should aim to get the arrow to land \nin the centre of the target. It is difficult for an archer to re-\nmember all the peculiarities about the wind along with the \ndirection and intensity. So they estimate a position where \nthey should aim their sight by judging the situation of the \nwind and conditions for each contest. An archer also de-\nvelops a “feeling” about the conditions at a contest and \ncomes to rely on each new “feeling” as they arise. There \nare times when an archer actually hits the point where \nthey placed their sight even when the wind is blowing \nquite strongly, and conversely, sometimes the release may \nbe conducted when the sight is further out from the point \nwhere the archer wished to release the arrow, and still the \narrow lands in the centre of the target. Because of these \nproblems there are many occasions where an archer loses \ntheir judging ability and competes in the contest without \nhaving any confidence. The wisest way for an archer to \ncultivate the habit of making an accurate judgement, of \nhow far to aim the sight off the centre of the target, is by \nbelieving in their judgement and ability during the con-\ntest and to produce strong and powerful shots."}

The wind can induce an \narcher to make mistakes which in turn reduces their over-\nall performance. It is possible that these archers will lose \nconfidence during a contest and fail because of the wind. \nHowever, the wind also causes other archers, in the con-\ntest, to make errors; it is the archer that makes the least er-\nrors that wins the contest. Just believe the wind is the god-\ndess of fortune for you. Y ou will find that if you develop \nthe thought that the wind will be favourable to you, and if \nyou do not let the wind worry you during normal practice \ntime and practice in the wind, the uneasiness of shooting \nin the wind during a contest will soon be overcome.\n12.1.11 When change of team tactics during a team \nround contest.\nWhen the wind blows during a team round the archers \nmust forget what each of the other members in their \nteam has to do and not become worried as to whether \none of them will make an error due to the wind. The \narchers should not give each other any advice about how \nfar to aim off from the centre of the target as all archers \nand equipment perform at different efficiencies, if ad-\nvice is given this could become counter productive and \ncause unnecessary errors. An archer’s observation of the \nflight of an arrow and making a judgement about how \nfar they should “aim off ” from the centre of the target \ncan be a great help in executing a good shot, but it must \nbe their own decision without any other archer’s input. \nIf an archer gives advice but makes an error themselves, \nthe archer following them will become unclear of where \nto aim and will possibly make a similar mistake. In a \nteam contest the best method of leading a team to suc-\ncess, is for each individual archer to exercise the maxi-\nmum concentration on their own performance. During \na team round the team coach must also be aware that if \nthey give a piece of advice, of where to aim, directly to \nan archer this could put doubt in their mind. This could \ninterfere with the archer’s concentration and produce a \nreduced performance.\nAlso, when the wind is blowing the archers in the team \nshould pay attention to the order of shooting. It is good \npractice to decide the order of shooting which will be \nmost effective; this order may be different when it is windy \nto that when the weather is calm. This differing shooting \norder should take into consideration all the traits of the \nthree archers. It is essential to consider all aspects includ-\ning: the psychological well being, the extending time and \nthe ability to adapt to the wind etc. of each archer.\n12.2 Measuring the archer’s ability to adapt to con-\ntrolled aiming in the wind.\nThe coach must know the archer’s ability, method and \nhabit to adapt to “aiming off ” from the centre of the target \nin windy conditions before introducing this procedure.\n12.2.1 Ability and consistency of the point of “aim-\ning off ” from the centre of the target during \nwindy conditions.\nIn conducting the “aiming off ” sighting procedure there \nwill be times when the archer will be uneasy or even un-\ncertain, and will make many errors. If an archer makes a \nsight change in advance of considering all the elements \nthe arrow will not land in the centre of the target. Now, \nif the archer uses this information and “aims off ” in the \nopposite direction by a similar distance that the arrow \nlanded from the centre of the target, it is likely that the \nnext arrow will now land in the centre of the target. If the \narcher calculates the measurement by changing the direc-\ntion of the shot i.e. “aiming off ” , the coach can identify the \narcher’s problems and can implement a training routine \nto remedy the situation.\n12.2.2 Considerations regarding how much to “aim \noff ” from the centre of the target.\nT o what extent do you “aim off ”?1. \nShould you “aim off ” for these conditions? If not, 2. \nwhy not?\nWhat direction and aiming point would give most 3. \nconfidence to hit the centre?\nWhat is the direction of the wind that you dislike 4. \nmost?\nWhat is the direction of the wind at the time of “aim-5. \ning off ”?\nWhat is the direction of shooting at the time of the 6. \nrelease?\nWhat is the archer’s general picture whilst observing 7. \nthe wind at the time of “aiming off ”?\nHow much is the deviation of distance between the 8. \nplace the arrow landed in the target and the position \nthe archer expected the arrow to hit by “aiming off ”?\nConsidering the above situations, the archer may de-9. \nvelop a psychological problem when confronted with \na tricky wind condition during competition time."}

If the intensity and direction of the wind is calculated \nby means of the above method, to a certain degree, the \ncoach can identify how much deviation and judgemental \nability the archer has and develop this area during their \nnormal training period.\n12.2.4 Observing the archer’s extending time.\nIf an archer takes note of the direction of holding power, \nbalance and the change of stance etc. when the holding \ntime is lengthened as a result of the wind, they can coun-\nter many problems. With this knowledge an archer can \nprepare for windy conditions through adaptations to their \ntraining routine. When an archer shoots quickly because \nof windy conditions it is likely that they will introduce \nmany errors, this in turn will affect their mental prepara-\ntion psychologically and make them uneasy. Therefore \nthe coach should anticipate and identify this condition \nadvance, and supplement the archer’s training routine by \nincorporating and practicing the necessary skills.\n12.2.5 Evaluating the psychology of the archer.\nA coach needs to know, in detail, the psychological state \nan archer when they shoot normally, and any psychologi-\ncal change when they “aim off ” during windy conditions. \nThis can be done by consultation or by questionnaires. \nSome archers may find it difficult to speak about this con-\ndition or their method of dealing with it because of their \npride. However, it is imperative that the coach discovers \neverything about their archer’s method of “aiming off ” \nand the effect this has on them psychologically as this will \nbecome a great help in preparing for the next contest.\n12.3 Methods of training in preparation to shooting \nin the wind.\nArchery competition has gone through the double FITA \nRound and the Grand FITA Round etc. and many chang-\nes have taken place and currently the Olympic Round of \nmodern times is the favourite. During the past double \nFITA Round, there was time for archers to observe the \nwind and adapt to it. However, in the present Olympic \nRound T eam event, the archer shoots only 9 arrows and \nin the case of an individual contest the archer shoots 12 \narrows, and the wind or rain becomes a decisive factor for \nvictory or defeat. Therefore, in extreme weather condi-\ntions most archers become worried about their perform-\nance during such a competition. Archers should change \nthis concept of thought; this is because no matter how \nstrong the wind blows the conditions are the same for \nall competitors. Most archers who worry about the wind \nusually fail in actual competition. If they had trained suf -\nficiently in preparing for the wind they would be able to \nadapt to all changing conditions. Only adapting the arch-\ner’s training routine, for shooting in the wind, outside of \ncompetition will make the archer confident of shooting in \nthe wind during a competition. An archer who fails dur -\ning windy conditions should discuss this with their coach \nand together discover the cause for the failure and find a \nremedy for the problem. As the wind is natural and not \nartificially made it is difficult to anticipate the direction, \npower or angle of the wind in advance. Consequently \nonly a thorough and composite training programme, in-\ncorporating these elements, will ensure the archer is fully \nprepared for all weather situations when they are encoun-\ntered during competition.\n12.3.1 T raining for physical power.\n12.3.1a An exercise of repeatedly drawing the bow for a \ngiven set.\nDuring windy conditions the extending time can be \nlonger than when shooting in calm weather conditions. \nDue to this, the main muscles that are used to draw the \nbow become tired quite rapidly and the balance and ex -\ntending power etc. collapses and mistakes begin to be \nintroduced. Therefore, a training routine for drawing the \nbow, including the extending time, should be conducted \nby slightly lengthening the time the bow is drawn to that \nwhen shooting in normal conditions. An exercise routine \nis outlined below:\nDrawing Recess Drawing Recess Drawing Recess Drawing Recess\n7 \nSeconds\n2 \nSeconds\n7 \nSeconds\n2 \nSeconds\n7 \nSeconds\n2 \nSeconds\n7 \nSeconds\n2 \nSeconds\nThe archer draws for 7 seconds, then returns to the \nstate of set-up and repeats the process continuously. If \nthe archer can practice this for 8 to 12 times their physi-\ncal power is sufficient, this will become one set. For this \nexercise to be effective it will be necessary for this routing \nto be practiced 3 to 5 sets a week."}

The archer will do this \nthree times for one set, and practice this routing for 3 to \n5 sets 3 times per week. During these sessions the archer \nshould maintain drawing the bow further than their nor -\nmal arrow length but maintaining the balance of extend-\ning and the direction of power, these training sessions \nshould be recorded on their normal training record card.\n12.3.2 T raining for the ability to aim at various points \naround the target face.\nSince it is difficult to predict the direction and intensity \nof the wind, the archer should cultivate the ability to aim \ntheir sight at all points around the target face with con-\nfidence. Also the archer can move their sight in, or out, \ntwo, three or four turns, then “aim off ” so that the arrow \nhits the centre of the target. In this way the archer receives \ntraining by sighting in many directions and they do not \nfeel uneasy when the sight pin is not on the centre of the \ntarget face, this also trains the archer to keep an accurate \ndirection of power. Even when it is not windy, sighting \nand aiming at different locations around the target face \ncan be conducted.\n12.3.3 Developing a sense of unity and direction of \nextending when “aiming off ” .\nAt the time when sight aiming at various points around \nthe target is being conducted, and even if the archers \n“group pattern” is in the centre of the target, the direction \nof extending should be in a direct line to the location of \nthe “aimed off ” position on the target face. There should \nbe a sense of unity between the direction of extending \nand this aiming point.\n12.3.4 The relationship between “aiming off ” and the \nfollow through.\nWhen the wind is blowing it is imperative that the archer \nmaintains the power line when extending. If the power \nline is not maintained: the bow arm shakes and the sense \nof direction of power can be lost. Consequently, the bow \narm will collapse at the time of the release and the arch-\ner tends to lose control of the bow arm. This undesired \nmovement can ruin the archers contest and the rhythm of \ncompetition is destroyed. The movement of the bow arm \nwhen the wind blows can be very lively. Archers should \nmaintain an accurate and continual sense of direction \nduring the sessions of normal training.\n12.3.5 The adaptation of changing the extending \ntime.\nIn general, most archers tend wait while the wind is blow-\ning and when there is a lull in the wind shoot quickly. This \nis the most ideal method and well known by most archers. \nBut the reason why it is important to adapt to the wind, \nand practice for this situation, is that the archer should be \nprepared for the worst conditions at all times. If an archer \nhas only 10 seconds left on the clock and they still have \none arrow to shoot, there will be only one chance to set \nup correctly and shoot it, there is no time for a second \nchance. Even if there is no wind the archer should prac-\ntice so that the balance and direction of extending cannot \nbe destroyed even if they intentionally lengthen their ex -\ntending time. And conversely, the archer may well prac-\ntice reducing the extending time during practice. Dur -\ning a team event, if archer number 1 or number 2 delays \ntheir shooting this reduces the time the archers following \nhave to shoot their three arrows, and need to shoot quite \nquickly, which maybe outside their normal shooting pat-\ntern. T o prepare for this likelihood archers should con-\nduct several training sessions of variable timing condi-\ntions in preparation for such occasions.\n12.3.6 Maintaining the balance of extending.\nDuring windy conditions the balance of extending var -\nies quite a lot compared with shooting on calm days. The \nreason for this is the movement of the body caused by the \nwind lengthens the time of extending which in turn causes \nthe archer to struggle to hold the sight on the given aim-\ning point. During this time archers should not conduct \nthe extending by artificial force i.e. using muscles that \nshould not be used to conduct the extending (biceps), or \nby curling the fingers of the string hand to get the clicker \nto activate. Even if the time of extending lengthens, arch-\ners should produce a mastery of the holding balance so \nthat a good shot is produced, if the holding balance is not \nmaintained the shot can be ruined.\nIf an archer feels or observes a change in the relation-\nship of the height of the bow shoulder and that of the ar -\nrow, along with any movement from the present position \nof the chest, they should seek help from their coach to \nremedy the situation before any unwanted problems de-\nvelop."}

This is not a good practice; at this time \nit would be better for the archer to “aim off ” while shoot-\ning to get the arrow to hit the centre of the target. During \na competition there is no time to practice sight aiming at \nother points around the target, the archer’ s judgement must \nbe accurate before shooting the arrow and the archer must \nhave confidence the arrow will fly to the centre of the target. \nDuring normal practice times, the archer should be made \naware of the importance to cultivate the ability to judge how \nmuch to “aim off ” for differing wind strengths and condi-\ntions, and they should strive to cultivate this ability.\n12.3.8 The observation and information gathering \nabout wind conditions of a sports ground be-\nfore taking part in a competition.\nMany archers and coaches are interested to gain informa-\ntion about the wind direction and intensity in the sports \nground where their next competition is to be held. A good \nindication, when at the competition ground, is to see any \nweather vanes or flags that may be fluttering in the vicin-\nity, and to calculate their movement intensity and direc-\ntion. Another indication of how the weather is affecting \narrow flight is to watch other archers’ arrow flight during \nthe practice time. A good coach will collect a lot of infor-\nmation from many people about the site before the com-\npetition begins. There are many differences, depending \nupon the season and/or layout of the sports ground. For \nsome prestige competitions, such as the Olympic Games, \nextra stands or structures are assembled. Y ou may know \nthe ground, or even have competed there before, but these \nnew structures will have an effect on wind conditions \nshould it blow during the event. Sometimes the direction \nof the wind changes; this will be most noticeable during \na seasonal change. With regard to a major competition, \nsuch as the Olympics, the coach should observe the wind \nand weather characteristics about one month before the \ncompetition and choose a similar site on which to prac-\ntice. During this practice time it is necessary to layout the \nfield in a direction so that the wind direction will be simi-\nlar to the wind direction of the forthcoming major com-\npetition. Also during this practice, It is also necessary to \nchange the direction of shooting occasionally so that the \narcher will be prepared should the wind change direction \nduring the competition. The reason for this is that on oc-\ncasions the wind may change direction quite suddenly. It \nis wise to observe all items that can measure, or indicate, \nwind direction or conditions and choose which gives the \nmost reliable information and refer to it.\n12.3.9 What to practice during open practice time.\nDetermine the location of “aiming off ” from the centre of \nthe target classified by distance.\nMeasuring the intensity and direction of the wind 1. \nclassified by time.\nObserve the arrow flight of other archers and consider 2. \nany anomalies.\nCheck the operation of any weather vane or flags in 3. \nthe vicinity.\nWatch other archers to see if they shake or shiver as a 4. \nresult of the wind.\nConsult with fellow team members and coach about 5. \nthe intensity of the wind.\nMake comparisons between the weather conditions 6. \nat the auxiliary practice ground and sports competi-\ntion ground.\nMake an observation of the wind conditions of the 7. \ncompetition field that will be used for the finals, the-\nses targets could be placed in the centre, or to the side, \nof the field.\nThe archer should observe and react to the wind rather \nthan concentrating on arrow flight at the time of open \npractice.\n12.3.10 Reference to other archers’ arrow flight at a \ncompetition.\nWhen the wind is blowing it is good practice to refer to \nother archers’ arrow flight. This can be very useful espe-\ncially when the weather vane changes direction or the \nfluttering of the flags changes intensity. It can also be very \nuseful during a team event, the archer who shoots first \nshould decide, after considering this information, how far \noff centre they should aim so that the arrow lands in the \ncentre of the target. The other team members then watch-\ning this arrow flight and seeing where it landed in the \ntarget can make calculations to benefit themselves when \nthey shoot. If an archer stands on the shooting line then \ntries to calculate where to aim, their mind will introduce \nmany conflicts and their judgement ability becomes un-\nclear. But conversely, if the archer has already calculated \nwhere they should aim before they come to the shooting"}

This \nis because each archer’s equipment and power of shot \nwill be different and therefore aiming points will differ. \nHowever, other archers or team members can pass on \nvaluable information i.e. the actual flight of their arrows. \nIf an archer watches the arrow flight of their colleagues, \ncalculations can be made to assist their decision on where \nthey, themselves, should aim.\nThis will be beneficial when taking part in team events \nduring competitions. This practice will develop a sense \nof unity in aiming even though the thoughts are differ -\nent, and it will reduce the conflict of judgement and the \nrhythm of competition will not be destroyed.\n12.3.12 Imagery training.\nWhen the wind is blowing an arrow does not fly in a \nstraight line to the target, so an archer becomes consider-\nably uneasy psychologically. Therefore it is good to prac-\ntice imagery training by picturing in ones mind the view \nof an arrow as it flies through the wind but still hits the \ncentre of the target.\n12.3.13 Adaptation to a momentary change in the \ndirection of the wind.\nIf the archery training field is large enough and if it is safe \nto do so, a good training aid is to have a target at each end \nof the field. The archer shoots their arrows at one target \nthen collects them; they turn round and shoot their ar -\nrows back down the range to the other target. This will \nhave the effect of shooting in constantly changing wind \ndirection and conditions.\n12.3.14 Choosing the right clothing for shooting in \nthe wind.\nWhen choosing clothing for shooting in the wind, it is \nimportant that no part of the clothing, i.e. the collar \nor sleeves etc., hinders or affects the path of the string. \nSometimes the sound of the sleeves fluttering can have \nan adverse effect on the archer’s concentration and cause \ndegradation in the quality of the shot. The archer should \nprepare for the wind and choose a uniform for competi-\ntion that has been thoroughly tested in windy conditions \nin advance of the competition.\n12.3.15 Selecting and tuning the equipment.\nIn windy conditions it is possible the position of sight \naiming and the selection of accessories will have an ef -\nfect on the tuning of the equipment. The weight of the \narrow point, the fletching type and size, the form of the \narrow etc. are directly linked to good arrow flight and the \noutcome of the archer’s performance. Also, the weight of \nthe bow and the selection of the stabiliser system have a \ndirect bearing when shooting in the wind and the archer \nmay need to consider the choice selected for any particu-\nlar occasion. Especially, consideration should be given to \nthe compatibility and tuning of the plunger button, and \nthe direction of the wind, should be thoroughly checked \nto ensure an efficient and smooth operation.\n12.3.16 Preparation, straightening out, and practice \nprior to, and after, a competition during windy \nconditions.\nWhen the wind blows the archer’s attention to the stance \nbecomes distracted. Therefore the archer should practice \nand concentrate on their stance shortly before the compe-\ntition begins. Also, after the competition is over the archer \nshould practice at a short distance the art of producing a \ngood stance. This is because they should be prepared for \nthe next competition. There are many situations where the \nbody forgets a “sense” very easily and comes accustomed \nto a new and sometimes incorrect body position. There are \nmany and various methods of rectifying this situation and \nmay seem to be complicated, but archers should not think \nof them as being complicated. With good training the arch-\ner can construct a habitual and reproducible action that is \nquickly achievable if the time lapse between producing the \nerrors and formulating the correction is not too long.\nDuring a competition many actions are made sub -\nconsciously. Many years ago we saw the case of an archer, \nJin Ho Kim (currently a professor at the College of Ko -\nrean Physical Education) where although she was “aim-\ning off ” we could observe that when the direction of the \nwind changed her body movement and state of holding \nchanged. This was possible because of her strict training \nroutine, in all weather conditions. The most important \npoint is for the archer to practice in the wind, come to \nrespect it and not to be afraid of it, and to create a sense of \nconviction that the wind will always help you."}

A heavier bow is easier to be \nheld steady whilst aiming, it is also more stable on release \nas it helps to reduce the effect of the string reflex on the \nbow; furthermore it is not so much affected in windy con-\nditions. In using stabilizers for shooting in the standard \nbow division one must keep in mind that the unbraced \nbow with its equipment including stabilization has to fit \nthrough a hole of 12.2 cm diameter.\nArrow rest\nAs the arrow rest and pressure point are not adjustable, \nensure that: -\nIf a simple pressure point is used the arrow sits in the • \ncentre of the pressure point. This can be achieved by \npositioning the arrow rest correctly in a vertical direc-\ntion, see figure 1.\nFigure 1\nThe pressure point allows the arrow to be pointed • \napproximately half an arrow width outside the string \nwhen the string is aligned down the centre of the \nbow.\nDepending what kind of riser is used the arrow rest may \nneed an underlying cushion to achieve the necessary off-\ncentre position of the arrow. The off-centre position has \nto compensate for the effect of the finger release with its \nstring reflex which will show up with novices more who \ntend to have a more explosive release than with advanced \narchers who should be able to release smoothly.\nT o get a proper off-centre position do the following: \nat first you have to check if the bow is truly aligned in it -\nself. With a ruler or a bow square you measure the width \nof the upper and lower bow limb where it meets the limb \npocket. Divide by 2 and make two marks 1-2 mm on ei-\nther side of that measured middle mark on either bow \nlimb, see figure 2.\nFigure 2\nNow, fix the bow in a vertical position and load with an \narrow; stand firmly about one meter back from the string, \nclose one eye and see the string lying in between these \ntwo marks on either limb. Now, without any movement, \nfocus on the point of the arrow and see where it is lo -\ncated in relation to the string. With right-handed archers \nthe right edge of the point should slightly touch the left"}

Also the part of the arrow rest where the \narrow actually rests on will get a groove thus imitating a \nnocking point that is too high after a few months of in-\ntense shooting. This especially happens when the archer \nis using the heavier aluminium arrows which are the only \nones allowed with the standard bow.\nBrace height\nThe Brace Height of the bow is the distance, measured at \nright angles, between the string and the grip pivot point \n(the deepest part of the grip) of the bow.\nAltering the length of the string will vary the brace \nheight of the bow. Lengthening the string will lower the \nbrace height and vice versa shortening the string will in-\ncrease the brace height.\nGeneral Bow manufacturer’s recommendations for \nbrace height are: -\nBow length Brace height\n66 inch – 8.25 to 8.75 inches\n68 inch – 8.5 to 9.25 inches\n70 inch – 8.75 to 9.5 inches\nThe best brace height for each individual bow will be \nfound somewhere between the recommended figures.\nAt some point between the recommended tolerances \nthe bow will sound quieter and the arrow groups will be \ntighter, this will be found to be the best brace height for \nthe bow. T o find this point the brace height should be al-\ntered by varying the string length, this can be achieved to \nsome degree by twisting or untwisting the string.\nThe brace height influences the initial horizontal \nbending of the arrow during the early stages of flight, as it \nchanges its dynamic spine of the arrow (see below under \narrows).\nBow sights\nThe use of a simple Bow Sight will enable the archer to \nget consistent aiming geometry and thus achieve a tighter \ngroup of arrows on the target face. A short sight extension \nmay be used keeping in mind that it must fit through the \nafore-mentioned hole when mounted.\nThe quadrilateral method of aiming is recommended \nfor use with a Bow Sight. Concentration on the Bow Sight \nalone will not give the archer the consistency they require, \nthe Coach should emphasize the importance of: -\nA consistent facial reference as the back sight:• i.e. \nthe alignment of the front and rear of the arrow in re-\nspect to the target to avoid vertical errors. An impor -\ntant factor is the tip of the nose and its point of con-\ntact with the string. The side of the nose does not give \nsuch a correct aiming geometry, as an archer cannot \nalways be sure that the same part (referring to the up \nand down position) of the string touches their nose; \nagain, highs and lows will occur.\nString alignment:• i.e. alignment of the string with \nthe same position on the bow for each arrow to avoid \nhorizontal errors.\nRight to left head movement will cause variation to string \nalignment.\nDraw length check indicator\nA Draw length check indicator is a device fitted to the \nbow to indicate to the archer that all arrows are drawn to \na predetermined length.\nThe introduction of a draw length check indica-\ntor too early in the archer’s development will inhibit \nprogress. A draw check indicator should not be placed \non the bow until the archer’s style has developed to the \nstage where the archer is able to consistently increase \nback tension during and after the sighting phase of the \nshooting sequence."}

When \nusing such an indicator the archer must learn to come to \nfull draw under control with the mirror and only then fo-\ncus on aiming. This is again best practiced, when draw -\ning back with the eyes closed, when at dull draw open the \neyes and check where the arrow or its reference point is \nsituated in the mirror.\nIt is strongly recommended not to switch the focus \nbetween mirror and target as firstly this destroys concen-\ntration on a proper shot performance and secondly tires \nthe archer’s eyes especially when they are focusing on the \ntarget butt (with the sight pin seen blurred) and not on \nthe sight pin (with the target face seen blurred) for their \naiming. Unfortunately, shooting with a mirror gives the \narcher one more visible point for the eyes to focus on; \nthis can interfere with the aiming process in a very un-\ncomfortable way so that the archer is disturbed in achiev-\ning a smooth and ongoing shot sequence.\nT o prevent back tension from coming to a stop at full \ndraw the archers should learn to slow down with their \nbackward movement of the string when the front cut end \nof the arrow can be seen at the lower rim of the mirror \nand then focus on aiming whilst continuing with increas-\ning back tension.

The “click” indi-\ncates that the arrow has been drawn to the correct length i.e. \nthe correct draw length has been established. Care should \nbe taken not to use the audible clicker as a release “trigger” \nif the sighting process has not been completed.\nCare should also be taken in mounting the clicker on \nthe bow to ensure: -\nThat there is no downward pressure exerted to the tip • \nof the arrow as it is drawn from under the clicker.\nThe clicker should ideally be mounted as near as vertical \nas possible to avoid extra pressure to the arrow tip from \nthe front, see figure 7.\nFigure 7\nIncorrect Correct\nIts tension should be strong enough to create a well audi-\nble “click” but not so strong as to press the arrow into the \npressure point thus reducing the off-centre position.\nAlso the side pressure exerted by the clicker should \nnot excessive, but is strong enough to enable an audible \nindication to be heard at the desired draw length.\nThis style of Draw Check Indicator ensures that back \ntension is being increased at the time of release.\nThe advantage of a clicker is that the optical system \nof the body gets a certain relief through an audible com-\nmand. A critical point in shooting with a clicker is to hold \nthe sight pin into the centre of the target face and having \neverything else ready at the time when it clicks.\nHow to shoot with a clicker: for the last few centime-\ntres before the archer comes to full draw the backward \nmovement of the release hand should slow down, at the \nsame time go on with increasing back tension and finding \nthe reference points of the face and correct aiming proce-\ndure, finally immediate release the string when the “click” \nis heard. The archer should release the clicker through \na continuous and smooth coming to full draw, and the \nclicker should then be the command for the archer to im-\nmediately release.\nWhen archers start using a clicker they should first \nhave mastered their form so that they have a constant \ndraw length. At first they should shoot at a butt from 5 \nmetres, and get used to the sound of the clicker and be \nable to produce a controlled release. With a coach close \nat hand they could try shooting with the eyes closed and \nconcentrate on:\na) Constant timing,\nb) The continuous increase of back tension, and\nc) The continuous movement of the release hand after \nthe release (dynamic release).\nSpecial care should be taken that the archer does not \nstart “sawing” underneath the clicker (forward-backward \nmovement of the arrow point) or “freezing” (no more \nmovement at all) or to stop-and-go, i.e. coming to a cer -\ntain point – then focusing on aiming – then start drawing \nagain for the final millimetre (s) to release the clicker.\nWhen to introduce shooting with a clicker?\nRecommendations differ; some say as early as possible \nin archery life, others say only after the archer has estab -\nlished a good form. If an archer has decided to go on with \nRecurve equipment they should be encouraged to use a \nclicker as early as possible to get used to it, to see it as"}

As draw \ncheck indicator the clicker is always more recommend-\nable than the mirror as with the clicker there is one visible \npoint less to focus on and the flow of the shooting process \nis easier to achieve.\nIt can take quite a while until an archer is used to get -\nting everything right when the clicker activates. T ests \nhave shown that the shorter the reaction time after the \nclick the smoother the release hand goes back as it comes \nas a natural consequence of the release. T o improve the \nreaction time it is a good idea to do additional training in \nother sports like table tennis or badminton.\nThe use of a clicker may be of special benefit to archers \nwho are “snap shooters” . They are in fact forced to go on with \ntheir backward movement of the release hand and come to a \nsolid full draw otherwise they do not get the click.\nT o get the proper clicker position an archer should \nrefer to their correct draw length, and of course, all ar -\nrows must be the same length. Have the archer draw an \narrow and mark where the point stops in relation to the \nsight window at a full and comfortable draw; this pro -\ncedure should be done firstly with the eyes closed and \nsecondly be repeated a few times to be sure of the cor -\nrect position. Be aware that if an archer has not yet prac-\nticed very often and the shoulder girdle is not yet fully \nadapted to the sportive effort, or when coaching juniors \nwho are not yet fully developed, the clicker position \nmay vary as a result of the development of the shoulder \nand upper chest area.\nIf the clicker has not been positioned correctly the \narcher may establish bad habits:\na) If the clicker is too close to the archer they may\nLean backwards.• \nDevelop tension in the drawing fingers.• \nSwitch from a low grip to a high grip intermittently to • \nget extra length.\nRotate the elbow of the bow arm into the path of the • \nstring.\nNot come through the clicker at all.• \nb) If the clicker is too far away from the archer they\nMay establish a high bow shoulder.• \nMay bring the head towards the string.• \nCertainly will not use back tension effectively.• \nArrows\nHow to find the appropriate draw and arrow length\nAccording to AMO (American Manufacturers Organiza-\ntion) the “standard” draw length measurement is deter -\nmined as the distance from the string (or the bottom of \nthe nock slot) to the pivot point (the most inner point) \nof the bow grip at full draw plus (to compensate for an \naverage design of the riser) 1 ¾\".\nT o find out an archer’s individual draw length either a \n“measuring” bow with a very light draw weight (about 5 \nlbs) or an elastic string may be used. Have the archer pull \nback the string together with a full length arrow so that the \narcher comfortably reaches full draw as practiced before. \nStand beside the bow and mark the arrow at the position \nof the front edge of the riser. This represents the individual \narcher’s draw length. When the archer’s arrows are to be \ncut, the mirror or clicker position respectively as well as \nthe length of the point have to be kept in mind. Thus, it \nis a good idea to have a second mark on the “measuring” \narrow to show you the proper clicker position or the best \nposition for the mirror which should already be mounted.\nT o get good and reliable readings it is recommended \nto have the archer closing their eyes and repeat the proce-\ndure a few times.\nIt is imperative that all arrows are the same length to \nmaintain a constant draw length when used in conjunc-\ntion with a clicker. Different lengths will also cause vari-\nations in weight, which will cause differing impact points \non the target; hence larger groups on the target.\nArrows should be matched to the bow by reference to \nan appropriate “Shaft Size Selection Chart” . These charts \nmatch the archer’s bow weight and draw length to enable \nthe correct arrow, for this combination, to be selected.\nWhat does mean XX75?\nThe XX75 is a cylindrical aluminium tube of special alloy \nand comes in different sizes, which concern the outside \ndiameter and wall thickness. The back end of the tube \nshows a reduced diameter and a nock taper where a nock \nof simple design can be glued on. It is also possible to get \narrows in different colours and different spines.\nSpine is a measure for the stiffness of an arrow. As we \nhave the string lying in the first finger crease when draw -\ning the bow and at full draw the string “rolls” , more or less, \nover the finger tips at release. This makes the string for -\nward movement, not in a straight line, but in a line simi-\nlar to a sine wave. As the nock follows this movement it \nmakes the arrow bend similar to the movement of a snake."}

For a proper arrow flight we need to have an \nappropriate flexing (or the correct stiffness) of the arrow. \nSee figure 8.\nFigure 8\nThe bending of the arrow during the initial stages of its travel.\nT o find the proper spine for a certain bow setup there are \nmany charts or computer programs on the market that \nwill help make the correct decision on which arrow spine \nto select.\nWhen measuring arrow spine rating an arrow of 29 \ninches is used, this is pivoted a half an inch in from each \nend and a weight of 880 grams (1.94 lbs.) is hung in the \nmiddle. A dial gauge measures the movement from the \nhome position of the arrow to the position now reached \nwith the weight suspended. This measurement is calcu-\nlated in 1,000ths of an inch to give the static spine rating of \nthis particular arrow. I.e. an arrow that deflects a ½ inch \n(0.5 of an inch) will have a static spine rating of 500, and \nan arrow that deflects ¾ inch (0.75 of an inch) will have a \nstatic spine rating of 750.\nBe aware that some of the smaller diameter arrow \nshafts may be measured at 26 inches instead of 28 inches. \nThis will depend on what type of arrows are purchased \nand what specification.\nOn some arrows you may see number like ‘1816’ or ‘2115’ \netcetera, this number is part of the spine identification sys-\ntem and means the ‘1816’ arrow has an outer diameter of \n18/64ths of an inch and 0.016 of an inch wall thickness, or \nthe ‘2115’ arrow has an outer diameter of 21/64ths of an inch \nand 0.015 of an inch wall thickness. We should keep one \npoint in mind: the arrow length in the selection chart does \nnot include the length of the point but is the distance from \nthe bottom of the nock to the front cut end of the arrow.\nIt is interesting to note that increasing the draw length \nby one inch has approximately the same effect as increas-\ning bow weight by two to three pounds; further calcula-\ntions can easily be made with the, afore mentioned, com-\nputer programs without buying new equipment.\nMany Arrow Selection Chart were formulated for \nmodern Recurve bows, standard 7% F.O.C (front of cen-\ntre) points for aluminium shafts, Fast Flight string and \nfinger release. For the slightly reduced efficiency of a Da-\ncron string which we have to use in the standard bow divi-\nsion we may subtract 3-5 lbs from the actual draw weight \nof the bow to select the correct arrow.\nIf we have a choice between two different arrow spines \nwe should take a few facts into account: Normally, we \nrecommend to opt for the stiffer one, in particular when \nwe have to deal with youngsters who are physically not \nyet fully grown or with beginners from whom we expect \nan increase of their draw weight, due to their longer draw \nlength as their skill improves; it is much easier to compen-\nsate for an over-spined arrow than for an under-spined ar-\nrow. In such cases it should be kept in mind that the wall \nthickness has a bearing on the weight of an arrow thus a \nheavy arrow may result in requiring a higher trajectory line \nthan a lighter arrow for the same distance to be shot. For \nindoor shooting that factor might not be of such impor -\ntance but shooting a distance of 50 metres the decision for \nan arrow should be influenced by that knowledge.\nFor competition all arrows should be of the same type \nfitted with identical fletches and nocks. Arrows must be \nmarked, on the shaft, with the archers name or initials.\nWe have already learnt what the spine of an arrow \nmeans; this has to do with the static spine which is just \na measure for the arrow’s ability to bend. The dynamic \nspine involves additional factors that occur during the re-\nlease and flight of the arrow:\nThe length of the arrow: the longer the arrow the • \nweaker it reacts with the same poundage.\nThe brace height: • \nwith a brace height being on the upper limit the • \nlimbs of the bow are more “compressed”; hence \nthe bow is stronger. Meanwhile the arrow leaves the \nstring at an earlier stage; reducing the power stroke.\nwith a lower brace height the limbs of the bow are less • \n“compressed”; hence the bow is lighter. Meanwhile \nthe arrow is driven by the string for a little longer dis-\ntance until it leaves it; increasing the power stroke. \n This changes the dynamic spine in so far that \nwith the lower brace height the arrow generally \nbehaves as if it was stiffer due to the decreased \nbow weight which means that a group of properly \ntuned arrows will have a tendency to hit more to \nthe left side of the target centre and the bare shaft \n(see right under basic tuning) hits more to the left \nof fletched arrows for right-handed archers (and \nright vice versa for left handed archers)."}

But changing the \nthickness of a nock point is no way to correct for an \nincorrect spine.\nTuning of a standard bow\nAlthough there are several restrictions concerning per -\nmitted accessories for shooting with a standard bow ac-\ncording to FITA rules we are not short of using basic tun-\ning methods to get as high scores as possible.\nThe basic tuning procedure for shooting a standard \nbow with aluminium arrows is the bare shaft test.\nNormally, we shoot with fletched arrows; the fletching \nbeing useful and necessary for stabilizing the arrow during \nits flight as soon as possible after it leaves the bow. The bare \nshaft test shows possible deviations of the desired arrow \nflight that would be compensated by the fletching. This is \nnot just bad performance of the arrow; it slows down arrow \nvelocity, thus creating a higher trajectory line, and in the end \nwill create wider groupings of arrows at a specific distance.\nOf primary importance is the location of the nock \npoint. A suggested starting point is to have the nocking \npoint set so that the bottom of the arrow is approximately \n5 millimetres above square, taking the vertical line of the \nstring with the bracing height gauge/bow square exten-\nsion resting lightly on the arrow rest. Fix a clamp-on nock \nlocator in that position, see figure 9.\nFigure 9\n90°\n5 – 6 mm\nThe first step is to find the correct nocking point for the \nindividual archer: have the archer shoot a few fletched ar-\nrows on a distance not more than 18 meters. Then shoot \nat least 2 unfletched arrows (bare shafts) aiming always to \nthe same point. If the unfletched arrows hit higher than \nthe fletched ones the nock point is too low and the archer \nshould move the nock locator slightly up approximately a \nhalf millimetre, then try again, and continue until the cor-\nrect result is achieved. If the unfletched arrows hit lower \nthan the fletched arrows the nock point is too high and \nthe nock locator should be moved down a half millime-\ntre then try again, and continue until the correct result is \nachieved, see figure 10.\nFigure 10\nThe worst situation is to have a nock point too low as the \narrow will fowl the arrow rest and get deflected upward \nwhen leaving the bow, thus creating a worm-like flight with \nup and down movements called Porpoising. T o confirm \nthat the nocking point is not too low, the bare shaft may hit \nabout one inch lower than the group of fletched arrows at \nshort distance. Also it should be remembered that due to \nthe stretching of a Dacron string during a practice day or a \ncompetition the brace height will decrease, this will affect \nthe relationship of the nocking point and arrow rest.\nThe next step in this test is to check for left and right \nimpacts of the bare shaft in relation to the group of fletched \narrows. We use again a distance of not more than 18 m for \nthis test. An over-spined arrow will have a bare shaft impact \ntoo much to the left of the fletched ones (we call that “too \nstiff ” for a right handed archer) see figure 11, whereas the \nunder-spined arrow will hit more to the right of them this \nis “too weak” for a right handed archer, see figure 12. For \nleft-handed archers the opposite direction is applicable. As \na rule of thumb we recommend that the gap between the \ngroup of fletched arrows and the bare shafts is not more \nthan 3 – 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) on 15 – 18 m distance."}

The word “slightly” is in bold letters \nas an arrow which is definitely one category over or under-\nspined cannot be compensated for with the changes men-\ntioned above. With such arrows the archer would get fish-\ntailing (right-left movement) during the arrow flight.\nWhen the correct arrow and bow setup has been found \nwith the bare shaft test the archer may go on with a more \nfinely tuning procedure which would be the variable dis -\ntance or walk-back method.\nSet up a target and pin on a piece of card about 7.5 \ncm square 20 cm from the top. Then place marks on the \nground from 20 to 50 metres in 5 metre increments from \nthe target. If necessary a second target can be placed in \nfront of and leaning on the target which is on the stand. \nThis will allow the archer to shoot from a greater distance \nproducing a more accurate result.

Stand on the 20 metre position marked \nout on the ground and shoot thee arrows at the piece of \ncard on the target, move back to the 25 metre position and \nshoot another three arrows, move back to the 30 metre po-\nsition and shoot another three arrows. The arrows may be \nretrieved as required, but before they are removed from the \ntarget mark the centre of each group of three arrows with a \ntarget pin, small disc of card or similar.\nContinue moving back and shooting until the line of \narrows/marks reach the bottom of the target, this will nor-\nmally be after 20 to 25 metres i.e. a shooting distance of 40 \nto 45 metres, which will be dependant on the efficiency of \nthe bow.\nAfter the whole process, connect the lines of target pins \nor small discs, which mark the centre of each group of ar-\nrows, with one single line from top to bottom.

In a normal individual there is approxi-\nmately 5-6 liters of blood in males and 4-5 liters in females, \nand it is not enough to fill all the blood vessels at the same \ntime. Therefore, there is a rational of blood distribution \nwhich is regulated by the vessels themselves and by the \nnervous system. According to the working state of the \norgans, the blood is directed by vasodilatation (enlarge-\nment of blood vessels) or vasoconstriction (narrowing \nof blood vessels) according to the priority of the working \nof the organs and muscles during work or rest, which is \ncalled shunting of the blood. Figure 1 shows the normal \nblood distribution in some of the essential organs. Com-\nponents of the cardiovascular system, therefore, are very \nimportant, especially during long lasting work.\nThere is some basic terminology that a coach should \nknow in understanding basic concept that leads up to the \napplication of terms. They are:\nHeart Rate (HR): Heart rate is the amount of \nbeats the heart performs under rest or work in one \nminute.\nStroke Volume (SV): Stroke volume is the \namount of blood pumped out of heart in each \nstroke or contraction.\nCardiac Output (CO): Cardiac output refers to \nthe volume of blood pumped by each ventricle of \nthe heart per minute. In a normal individual CO is \napproximately 5 l.min.\n–1 (liter per minute) at rest \nand may increase to 40 l.min–1 during intensive ex-\nercise.\nThus, CO = HR × SV\nCardiac output is determined by heart rate and \nstroke volume\nT ogether, the heart and blood vessels provide not only \nlife itself but the physiological basis of all activity, and the \nability to work and sustain the activity for some duration \n(Figure 1). Under almost all different working states there \nis a fluctuation in HR to help maintain effective blood \npressure within the circulation system. Increase in HR to-\ngether with increase in SV , enhance CO, and thus provide \nthe working muscle with essential supplies of oxygen and \nsubstrate to fuel muscular contraction.\nSimilar to other muscles, the heart will, also, respond \nto regular exercise. T raining increase the heart’s ability \nto contract forcefully which improves the cardiovascular \nsystem’s capability to distribute blood via an improved \ncapillary network. These adaptations contribute to the \nperformer’s ability to undertake continuous steady exer -\ncise. This becomes very important in many sports to last \nfor the duration of training or competition. In archery, for \nexample, it is important to have the long lasting training \nor competition performed without any sign of fatigue or \nloss of quality in archer’s shots.\nAs a result of effective training on cardiac function \nis a larger CO, enhanced SV , and a lower HR for a given \nintensity of exercise or work. Reduced stress on cardio -\nvascular system as a whole and on HR will increase the \nstability and aiming steadiness during shooting, because \na lower HR increases the probability to release the arrow \nbetween two heartbeats; beside increasing the working \ncapacity of an archer.\nMaximal HR of an athlete, and at what ratio of maxi-\nmal HR the training of a given biomotor ability, and the \ntraining conducted (intensity) are important. Although \nthe athletes differ in maximal HR, and training reduces \nthe achieved maximal HR values, for the average popula-\ntion, the maximal HR is calculated by below equation:\nMaximal HR = 220 – Age\nIt has been observed that for each year of aging there is \na tendency of one beat reduction in Maximal HR.

Figure 2 gives \nsome idea of how the cardiovascular system affects the \nperformance or training outcome of endurance ability.\nIII. Bioenergetics\nLiving organism needs energy to continue the living \nform, and to work. Depending on the intensity, duration, \namount of muscles employed, and the form of muscles \nused in work, the required amount and the type of en-\nergy is different. Depending on the rate of energy require-\nment, there are three basic systems to supply energy for \nthe working muscles. The intensity and the duration of \nthe exercise determines which energy system is going to \nbe used (Figure 3).\nThe aim of the energy systems is to resynthesize the \nenergy rich phosphagen called adenosine triphosphate \n(ATP). This is the only biochemical compound that \nprovides the necessary energy for muscle to contract by \nsplitting into inorganic phosphate (P) and adenosine di-\nphosphate (ADP). Once the ATP initiated the contrac-\ntion by providing the energy, the three energy systems \nprovide energy to resynthesize ATP for following splits \nto provide new energy source for muscle contraction and \nwork. Depending on the intensity and duration of mus -\ncle work, the rate of energy production is dictated and \nthe energy system is determined. Thus, any exercise re-\nquires an energy supply, and there are different energy-\nsupplying systems that their energy supplying power and \ncapacity depends on the intensity and duration of work. \nAs a coach, therefore, to be able to draw up an optimal \ntraining schedule the energy supply system has to be well \nunderstood.\nIntensity and duration elements of the exercise are \nthe determining factor for the energy system employed. \nFigure 2: Factors influencing endurance working capacity\nFigure 3: Energy for muscle contraction\nMax HR Max SV Capillar density\n(Hb); %SaO2\nMax (Ca-Cv O2)Max CO\nMax VO2 %VO2 max \nat a given LT\nWorking rate \nat given LT\nWorking rate\n(or performance)\nHB: hemoglobin\n%SaO2: Oxygen saturation ratio of blood\nCa-Cv O2: Artero-venos oxygen difference\nLT: Lacteta Thresold; a given level of blood lactate\n(i.e. 2 mmol\n–2 or 4 mmol–1)\nWorking \neconomy\nOksidative \nEnzymes\nMuscle Contraction\nATP ADP + Pi + Energy\nATPase\nEnergy for Contraction"}

Three forms of \nenergy systems are named as (1) phosphagen system, \nsome times it is also, referred as alactic anaerobic energy \nsystem or phosphocreatine or ATP-CP system, (2) lac-\ntate or glycolysis system, it is also called lactic anaerobic \nenergy system, and (3) the oxygen system, which is also \ncalled as aerobic energy system. (Figure 4) shows the \nsimultaneous contribution of the three energy systems \nduring intensive work.\nPower and capacity of each energy system is different. \nEach energy system has its advantage and disadvantages. \nFor example, the phosphagen system provides very im-\nmediate energy for very high and rapid movements. Such \nas short sprints and/or short acts of strength, such as ap -\nplying strength to the string when drawing the bow. How-\never, although it provides very rapid energy, lasting from \nfew seconds up to 8 or 10 seconds at maximal or sub-max-\nimal efforts, it is very short lasting. On the other hand, the \nlactate energy system lasts for longer duration for rapid \nworks, such as long sprinting, rowing, or repetitive move-\nments lasting for 30 to 45 seconds at maximal or sub-\nmaximal intensities. This energy system is longer lasting, \nbut the energy production over a unit of time (power) \nis less than compared to the phosphagen system. Despite \nthe fact that this type of work is limited in archery, it is \nimportant that some exercises are done within the scope \nof this energy system to with stand the fatiguing load of \nsome specific movements. The oxygen system, also called \nthe aerobic system, is the longest lasting but the least rap-\nid energy provider among the three systems. It, therefore, \nhas the highest capacity in terms of amount of energy \nproduced for ATP resynthesis, but has the lowest power \nin terms of providing rapid energy (T able 1).\n1. The Phosphagen System\nThe phosphagen system supplies energy without any \nneed of oxygen and production of lactic acid. The muscle \nhas a limited store of ATP , together with another source \nof energy similar to ATP called creatine phosphate (CP). \nLimited ATP stored in the muscle is backed up by CP for \nthe resynthesis of ATP for rapid work. The store of CP is, \nalso, very limited but is able to provide very rapid energy \nfor the resynthesis of ATP (Figure 5, Figure 6).\nLimited store of ATP and CP in the muscles forces \nthis energy system to function up to 8 to 10 seconds. ATP \nstores last about 2 seconds and the amount of CP con-\ntribute for another 6 to 8 seconds during rapid and maxi-\nmal work. Under all circumstances the supply of energy \nfor muscle contraction and work has to be through ATP \nbreakdown. ATP breakdown is backed up by CP , and this \nFigure 5: Energy production and relative contribution of energy \nby different energy systems\nPercent Capacity of energy systems\nExercise duration\nShort-term systems\n(glycolysis)\nImmediate system\n(ATP-CP)\nLong-term system\n(aerobic)\n100%\n10\nSec\n30\nSec\n2\nMin\n5\nMin\nFigure 4: Energy for muscle contraction by different \nenergy systems\nMuscle Contraction\nThe Phosphate \nSystem (CP)\nThe Lactate System\nThe Oxygen System\nADP + Pi ATP\nATP Synthase\nATP ADP + Pi + Energy\nATPase\nT able 1: Power and Capacity of Three Energy Systems\nSystem max power\n(kcal.dk-1)\nmax capacity\n(Total kcal)\nATP-CP 36 11.1\nAnaerobic Glycolysis 16 15.0\nAerobic\n(Only glycogen) 10 2000"}

This system is, therefore, very important to initi-\nate any activity, whether it is low or high intensity, and at \nthe high intensity movements such as sprinting, jumping, \nrapid pulling, pushing, applying different kinds of force \nor power applications.\nAfter the breakdown and exhaustion of the CP in the \nmuscle stores, the resynthesis process is also very rapid. \nThe resynthesis of high-energy phosphates (ATP + CP) \nafter work is replenished within few minutes. Approxi-\nmately 70% of the phosphagens are replenished in 30 sec-\nonds and 100% in 3 to 5 minutes (Figure 7).\nThus, training of the phosphagen system has to be \nshort, explosive, and limited in number of repetitions, \nand alternated with long rest intervals for the replenish-\nment of phosphagens.

Both type of train-\nings, therefore, not only increase ATP and CP stores \nbut also speeds up the process of rebuilding ATP and \nCP. Increased ATP and CP adaptations and enhanced \nenzyme activity can only be brought about by well de-\nsigned endurance, strength and power trainings for the \narcher. These training adaptations will enable the archer \nto shoot similar shots more repetitively, have higher ca-\npacity for training, and develop less fatigue at the end of \nthe training session.\n2. The Lactate System\nNormally, the human body prefers to use the oxygen sys-\ntem to produce energy for all functions of the body, in-\ncluding muscular work. However, if the level of muscular \nexertion increases and it passes the point at which the aer-\nobic energy system is unable to produce enough energy \nto keep up with the work demand, the anaerobic or the \nlactate energy system begins to produce and contribute \nenergy for the work. The contribution or amount of en-\nergy produced depends on the intensity and duration of \nthe exercise, and the ability of the aerobic energy system \nto produce energy under such intensity of exercise. The \nlactate energy system, therefore, is an additional energy \nsystem to contribute both to the phosphagen system, in \ncase of a high intensity of exercise lasting more than 8 to 10 \nseconds, and/or to produce additional energy to meet the \ndemands of the work, in the case of the aerobic energy sys-\ntem, where it is unable to produce such amount of energy \nat a required rate. However, due to slow reaction of the \naerobic energy system to the pace and demands of exer -\ncise, similar to the phosphagen energy system, the lactate \nenergy system as well contribute to the energy demands of \nthe work right from the onset of exercise whether it is low \nor high intensity. Involvement of the lactate energy system \nin energy production under such conditions shows itself \nby the by product of lactic acid as a result of break down of \nglycogen in the absence of oxygen in the cell (Figure 8).\nIncrease of lactate at cellular level during anaerobic work, \nchanges the acidity of the cell, which is an indication of \nmuscular fatigue. After a certain level of acidity, depend-\ning on the individual and training level, the chemical reac-\ntions slow down drastically, and force the athlete to slow \nor even to stop working. This condition is called acidosis. \nMuscle soreness is a typical characteristic of acidosis. In \nsome sports such as middle distance running, rowing, \ncycling where the lactate energy system is used predomi-\nnantly the athletes are often faced with acidosis. Increase \nof blood lactate levels is an indication of anaerobic supply \nof energy, and deficiency of aerobic energy system for a \ngiven level of intensity of work. Increase of blood lactate \ncan be 20 times higher than resting levels, reaching well \nabove 20 mmol/l level in some cases.\nAs explained above, high levels of lactate accumulation \ncause acidosis in and around the muscle cells which in re-\nturn alters the reactions and mechanisms in the cell. One \nof the mechanisms seriously disturbed by this change in \nthe cell is the aerobic enzyme activity by which the aero -\nbic energy production is unable to function. As a result of \nthis, the endurance capacity of the muscle cell is reduced. \nIf this type of work is repeated without sufficient rest in \nbetween the workouts, the aerobic energy system, and \ntherefore, the endurance capacity of the athlete is ham-\npered for some period or overtraining state may develop. \nFigure 8: The Lactate Energy System\nADP + Pi ATP\nATP Synthase\nGlycogen CO2 + H2O + Energy\nATP Synthase\nLactic Acid\nATP ADP + Pi + Energy\nATP Synthase\nMuscle Contraction"}

There-\nfore, under such conditions work of archery technique or \nskill is not recommended.\nThe acidosis state does not only slow down the reac-\ntions and mechanisms of the muscle cells, but also dam-\nages the cell walls leading to leakages from the muscle cell \ninto the blood. This state causes changes in the blood, \nand after heavy workouts as an indication of fatigue and \nmuscle cell damage there are high readings of blood val-\nues of uera, creatine kinase, aspertate aminotransferase, \nand alanine aminotransferase. Normalization of this state \nmay take up to 1 to 4 or 5 days after the completion of the \ntraining. After a heavy workout the body eliminates half of \nthe lactate in approximately 15 to 25 minutes in a passive \nrest state. Approximately 90-95% of the accumulated lac-\ntate is removed after about an hour. After a heavy workout \nthe accumulated lactate is removed at a much faster rate if \nthere is a light exercise state for rest or recovery instead of \ncomplete rest.\nThe lactate energy system uses only muscle glycogen \nfor energy production for ATP resynthesis. At high lac-\ntate state in the muscle cell, glycogen cannot be used and \nthis state in return decreases the use of fats as energy sub-\nstrates. Without the use of glycogen, fats cannot be me-\ntabolised in the cells as energy source.\nTypical lactate workout may start from short distances \nsuch as 100 to 800 meter runs or 20 seconds up to 3 to 4 \nminutes of very intensive workouts. The workouts in the \nrange of 20 to 45 seconds are more dominantly rely on the \nlactate energy system and less on aerobic energy produc-\ntion. When the time is increased towards 3 to 5 minutes \nof heavy work, the contribution of aerobic energy sup -\nply is increased to almost 50 %. Except for very specific \nworkouts, the use of lactate dominant training content in \narchery is very limited.\nThus, technique training is not recommended when the \nblood lactate levels are exceeding 6 to 8 mmol/l levels. High \nlactate values, therefore, increase the risk of muscle injury. \nIt is, therefore, recommended that the caution for recovery \ntraining is taken after lactate predominant trainings.\n3. The Oxygen System\nThe oxygen system, also, refers as aerobic energy system, \nis the physiological foundation of the endurance per -\nformance. Archery is one of the exceptional events that \nrely on aerobic energy system, and it is regarded as an \nendurance event. However, the archer does not show a \ntypical aerobic capacity and power of a marathon runner \nor cross-country skier, or even a soccer player (T able 2). \nY et the endurance ability that is described for the archer \nis very critical in the success of an archer, and, therefore, \nthe foundation of endurance ability has to be well under-\nstood by the coach.\nThe oxygen or aerobic energy system is an ability of \nprocessing the nutrients in the presence of oxygen. In oth-\ner words, the ability of the energy system to produce en-\nergy from carbohydrates, fats and proteins in the presence \nof oxygen during rest and activity. Compare to other two \nenergy systems, the oxygen system is relatively non-time-\nrelated way of producing energy for work. Under normal \nconditions body utilises carbohydrates and fats as main \nenergy source, and under starvation and prolonged exer -\ncise conditions rely on proteins. In terms of energy, depot \nfat is almost unlimited source of energy, provided that \nthrough training the metabolism adapts to the utilisation \nof fats. Carbohydrates are consumed as sugars, starches, \nand glucose and stored in the liver and muscles as glyco -\ngen, and easily utilised by the body as a source of energy. \nThe store of glycogen in the liver and muscles is relatively \nlimited, and under intensive aerobic work, the sources are \nto provide approximately 2000 kcal or enough to last 60 \nto 90 minutes. It is interesting to also note that the lactic \nacid that is produced during anaerobic work, also, utilised \nas substrate, similar to glycogen, by the aerobic energy sys-\ntem in muscles, liver, and the heart muscle. This is the basic \nmechanism to eliminate the lactic acid from the working \nmuscles and circulating blood (Figure 9).\nSport\nMax Oxygen Consumption\n(ml.kg–1.dk–1)\nMale Female\nMarathon Running 75-80 65-70\nCross-Country Skiing 75-78 65-70\nSoccer 55-60 48-52\nTennis 48-52 40-45\nGymnastic 45-50 40-45\nRythmic Gymnastic ------ 40-45\nSailing 50-55 45-50\nArchery 39-51 34-42\nShooting 40-45 35-40\nT able 2: Maximal Oxygen Consumptin in Different Sports"}

From \nthe economy point of view, the tendency of the body is to \nuse fats as source of energy since this source of substrate \nprovides the highest amount of energy for the resynthe-\nsis of ATP per molecule of substrate. However, when the \nintensity of work becomes very critical, such as running \nfaster or working harder to win, the organism prefers the \nfuel of which provides higher energy source for per litre \nof oxygen. In this case, glycogen is a better source of ener-\ngy to yield higher amount of energy in the resynthesis of \nATP (Figure 10). Therefore, during low intensity of work, \nthe mechanism has the tendency of using free fatty acids \nin greater percentage compare to glycogen, as the avail-\nability of oxygen is not critical. As the rate or intensity \nof work is increased, the ratio of utilisation shifts towards \nglycogen as a result of critical amount of oxygen availabil-\nity for energy development. Increase in aerobic fitness \nincreases the usage of fats in the organism. Thus, in en-\ndurance trained athletes, for a given intensity of work, the \nutilisation of fats as energy source is increased. Therefore, \nthe athletes are able to work at much higher paces due to \ncarbohydrate sparing effect of training. The glycogen as \na source of energy called at much higher work loads due \nto increased fat utilisation of the body. Maximal oxygen \nconsumption or VO2 max is an indicator of a developed \nendurance ability of an athlete. The capacity to utilise the \ngreater percentage of VO2 max at a given value is a good \nindicator of endurance performance. Max VO2 values \ncan be increased up to 50 percent by training.\nUnder all conditions, the organism prefers to use the \noxygen system since it is more economical and has more \ncapacity for the production of energy for ATP resynthe-\nsis. However, as mentioned in the phosphagen and the \nlactate systems, the oxygen system has a limitation in its \npower to provide energy in a unit of time. If the required \namount of energy for a given time and intensity exceeds \nthe power of aerobic system (T able 1), than the anaero -\nbic energy systems provide the extra needed energy for \nmuscular work. Furthermore, aerobic system functions \nwith the provision of oxygen in the cell, within the mi-\ntochondrias where the aerobic breakdown of substrates \ntake place (Figure 10).\nFor increased rate of work, the aerobic energy system \nneeds extra amount of oxygen to meet the elevated level \nof energy for the ATP resynthesis. However, depending \non the elevated level and the intensity of the work, the \nextra amount of oxygen has to be provided by increased \nlevel of HR (Heart Rate), circulation and transport of \noxygen within the cell. These mechanisms are unable to \nmeet the pace of the work immediately, and they have a \nlack of pace. Due to this delay, the aerobic energy produc-\ntion is unable to meet the required energy demands, and \nFigure 9: Elimination of lactic acid (The Cori cycle).\nBlood Glucose\nBlood Lactic Acid\nMuscle GlycogenLiver Glycogen\nFigure 10: The oxygen or aerobic energy system and ATP \nresynthesis by the breakdown of substrates.\nGlycogen\n+\nO2\nH2O\n+\nCO2\n+\nEnergy\n(33 mol ATP)\nLactic Acid\n(Glucose)\n+\nO2\nH2O\n+\nCO2\n+\nEnergy\n(33 mol ATP)\nFree Fatty \nAcids\n(Palmitic Acid)\n+\nO2\nH2O\n+\nCO2\n+\nEnergy\n(129 mol ATP)\nProteins\n(Glucose)\n+\nO2\nH2O\n+\nCO2\n+\nEnergy\n(129 mol ATP)"}

Usually it takes about 2 to 3 minutes for the \naerobic mechanism to adapt the pace of the work in train-\ning or competition. Therefore, as the work time increases, \nthe oxygen system becomes more dominant in producing \nenergy for the resynthesis of ATP and work (T able 3).\n4. Energy Systems and T raining\nIt is some times very difficult for the coach to understand \nthe simultaneous contribution of energy production of \nenergy systems when explained as above. One gets the \nfeeling that each and every energy system functions sepa-\nrately, depending on the intensity and duration of work. \nThis is not true. In fact all energy systems function at the \nsame time simultaneously. However, depending on the \nintensity and duration of the exercise, and of course, the \ntraining level of the athlete, each energy system has a ratio \nof contribution at a given time and state. It is therefore, \nvery important to understand the intensity and duration \nelements of the workload, since they are the determining \nfactors in which energy systems work. When the energy \nsystems are adapted for practical training concept, differ-\nent training areas or zones can be identified (T able 4). \nEach training zone, therefore, depending on the intensity \nand duration, has many training methods of which have \nsimilar characteristics of physiological adaptations. In \nother words, each intensity and duration characteristics \ntraining elicit different physiological adaptation (T able \n4). It is, therefore, very important for the coach to rec-\nognize the training zones and their characteristics in elic-\niting physiological adaptations, which are important for \nthe sport in question. In this case, archery is an endurance \nbased event, where the archer is involved with repeated \nshots, which are alactic anaerobic. With long lasting ac-\ntivity, active or passive, during the day, inter spread with \nshots, the aerobic system is taxed. This taxation is not ex-\nhaustive (Figure 11), but yet, very critical that meets the \nrequired demands, without any slightest loss of ability \ndue to fatigue after some shots in the progress of compe-\ntition or training.\nMost archers pay extra attention to the bow, strings \nand arrows, and they try to keep technologically up to date \nand sound equipment. However, in most cases similar at-\ntention is not paid to the fitness level, especially the gen-\neral and specific endurance components, which are very \nimportant prerequisites for success.

For strength and coor-\ndination, training for phosphagens intensity zone should \nbe employed for specific fitness (T able 4).\nIV . Structure and Function of the Skeletal Muscle\nSkeletal muscle is the main source of the movement \nmechanism, where the generation of strength is formed \nfor the movement. And, thus, without the skeletal muscle, \nmovement cannot take place. The human body contains \nover 400 skeletal muscles with different sizes and shapes. \nAnd as the human body is shaped through growth and \ndevelopment, the final formation is also formed (T able \n5). From these figures it is apparent that almost 40 to 50% \nof the body weight is constituted out of muscles. Skeletal \nmuscle has four main functions in the body: (1) to gener-\nate force for locomotion, (2) force generation for posture, \n(3) force generation for breathing, and (4) heat produc-\ntion under cold stress. As coaches, this short section will \ndeal with the force generating ability of the skeletal mus -\ncle.\nMost noticeable function of the skeletal muscles is to \nenable to move, to have a postural form, and to help to \nbreathe. In order for the skeletal muscle to generate force, \nit has to be attached to a bone or bones. From one end it \nhas to have an attachment of origin, in order to move the \nother end of the attachment (insertion) for locomotion \nor pull the string or push the bow. The muscles are at -\ntached to the bones by tough and resilient connective tis-\nsue called tendons. T o keep muscle intact there are three \nlayers of connective tissue: Epimisium, covers the whole \nmuscle, the outer layer. If it is moved one step down in the \nmuscle, perimisium is the layer which surrounds the mus-\ncle bundle. Each muscle fiber or the cell within the mus -\ncle bundle is surrounded by the inner layer endomisium. \nThese layers end up forming the tendons for the connec-\ntion to the bones at each end, where the force is applied \nto the bones as muscle contract (Figure 12).\nThe smallest unit of the muscle that contracts is called \nmyofilaments. These are the contractile protein struc-\ntures, and are composed of two proteins called actin and \nmyosin. The myosin proteins are the thicker proteins \nstructures with some arms extending, which are called \ncross-bridges by which they connect to special sites of \nT able 5: Muscle development during growth and development\nFigure 11: HR mean values and lactate values of 6 top level female archers during and in between series\n140\n135\n130\n125\n120\n115\n110\n105\n100\n95\n90\n1 2 3 4 5 6 Series\nHR La\n(mmol/l)\nDuring series\nBetween series\nHR\nDuring\nSeries\nBetween \nSeries\nLactate \n(mmol/l)\n1st series 125.4 102.8 2.1\n2nd series 126.5 103 1.77\n3rd series 122.7 102.5 1.7\n4th series 120 103.5 1.5\n5th series 120 95.2 1.5\n6th series 116.2 98.27 1.4\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\nAge % of body weight\n4–6\n7–10\n10–12/13\n12/13–14/15\n16/19\n19/22\n20\n23\n25–28\n30–35\n33–45\n45–50"}

Energy supply is almost \nfully aerobic, utilising free fatty acids, mainly in the type I \nmuscle fibers. Increase pace or activity level will shift the \nenergy source towards carbohydrates, and well trained \nendurance athletes can maintain this type of aerobic ac-\ntivity for about 1 to 2 hours, leading almost to the exhaus-\ntion of the muscle glycogen reserves of the Type I and \nType IIa muscle fibers. More intensive activities such as \nrunning or moderate to high sprinting will activate Type \nIIa and perhaps Type IIx muscle fibers utilising the lactate \nand as well as the phosphagen energy systems. If the work \nintensity is elevated to such trainings as maximal sprint \ntraining or high intensive intervals, Type IIx muscle fib -\ners are activated.

Despite the fact that there is not a high de-\nmand of strength in a single draw, but when the total ac-\ntivity during training or competition is considered, the \ntotal draws and demand of strength level becomes an \nimportant prerequisite. Archery does not demand high \nmaximal strength as in throwing or explosive events. \nHowever, it requires certain basic all round strength in \norder to build specific strength on top of it. In archers \nthere is a general tendency to work on specific muscle \ngroups and develop specific strength without forming \na suitable general strength foundation. It is, therefore, \nrecommended to first develop general strength or form \nanatomical preparation, including whole body muscle \ngroups, as well as specific muscle groups for drawing the \nbow and shooting. This work is then followed by maxi-\nmal strength work for certain muscle groups to form ap -\npropriate foundation for specific strength work, which \nhas to be followed (Figure 16).\nIt should be kept in mind that strength training should \nbe planned according to time available for training and \ncompetition, as well as strength development duration \nnecessary for physiological adaptation. Strength does \nnot only develop through muscle hypertrophy, but also, \nthrough inter and intra neuromuscular coordination. In \nfact, strength development due to muscular coordination \ntakes place before the hypertrophic development. There-\nfore, the training design and the number of general and \nspecific strength exercises should be planned accordingly. \nFigure 16 shows that strength training should be carried \nout the whole year round.

These coaches have dedicated many hours of their time putting down on paper their experiences and coaching knowledge that they wish to share with all coaches around the world. These documents have been collated into this one document by a small number of reviewers who again have given their time so willingly and it has been a pleasure to be a small part of the team. There are many types of book that can give much pleasure, such as mystery books and romantic books etcetera. I hope that this book will give as much pleasure and be seen as a reference book to be read and referred to throughout each coach’s career. There are many ways to teach and coach new archers. This manual shows a sound basic method which has been tried and tested over many years in many countries. When the archers have reached a certain level or the coach needs to increase their knowledge then referring to the Intermediate Level (World Archery Level 2) manual would be an option. Technical developments are continually advancing the progress of archery. This, along with new developments in shooting techniques, will bring new and advanced horizons in our sport. With these advancements I envisage new goals being achieved which in itself will bring greater heights of excitement and satisfaction. With this greater enjoyment I can see our ancient sport growing into a major sporting activity. Other areas in this manual will show the names of the contributors to this important Entry Level Coaching Manual but I would like to add my thanks to everyone who helped to bring this manual to fruition, Thank You.

Congratulations to everyone who is already a level 1 archery coach and wishes to update their knowledge and skills. Thank you for serving the World Archery Community. Best wishes to those of you who are starting or considering starting to teach our wonderful sport to novices. A fantastic experience is ahead of you. Whatever your teaching or coaching profile is, I hope that you will enjoy this revised manual that includes many new and useful coaching tips. As for the first edition, we* tried, as much as we could, to suggest how to have a practical approach in coaching novice archers. The first edition has been translated into several languages and introduced into the National Coaching Certification Programme in many countries. This second edition should receive a similar or better response from the archery world. The most important thing is that it helps you in your endeavours to coach beginners. As good as this manual may be there are other methods, ways, processes, tips, exercises, concepts… that are effectively used with beginning archers. If you have any special techniques that you find successful we would appreciate it if you would share them with the World Archery community; simply by contacting the World Archery office. * To know who the persons behind the “we” are, see the chapter “Thanks to the Contributors”. It is much appreciated that the contributors have shared their experience and knowledge with us to help produce this manual. Thank you so much to each and every one!

This philosophy will be the connecting thread between the different technical and demonstrative chapters of the manual. Manual Objective Some general preliminary comments are necessary to understand the main considerations in the coaching of our sport. People using this manual should consider, first of all, that this is not a technical publication intended to improve the shooting level of the readers, but a document written with the purpose of explaining the teaching process of archery and the fundamentals of coaching within the sport of archery. There is a clear difference between these two objectives which will become evident later in this manual. In comparison to many available publications that explain how to properly handle the bow & arrows, the objective of this manual is to provide suggestions on how to teach novice archers, that means how to transfer our know-how to other persons. It has been found that people who understand the technical fundamentals and can demonstrate them correctly are usually good coaches. Therefore, in this manual, the priority has been on good teaching with a strong emphasis on the visualization and demonstration of the different technical steps. The Archery Coach Candidate Even in countries that have only recently become involved in archery, technical information has been widely disseminated through several types of media, including the WORLD ARCHERY website, the Internet, or specific archery publications. This dissemination of information could incite and help some archers to become archery coaches. It may even inspire them to participate in a level 1 coaching course. However a minimum level of expertise (practical experience, technical competencies, competition background…) is a considerable bonus in guiding the development of the novices. The archery expertise of the \ncoach candidates and how it can contribute to their becoming efficient coaches is discussed below. Each former archer has reached a certain level of proficiency through a progression path. (The red line in the illustration below.) \n Those who have subsequently become coaches, wish their students to both achieve a better level than they themselves did and to do so through a straighter path. (The blue line illustrated above.) The Novice archer A “novice” is defined as a person who has little or no background in our sport. The level 1 archery coach could possibly encounter persons that already have had some experience in archery (even if only from Summer Camps). This experience, which is usually technically incomplete, could be a bonus but sometimes is not, as possible incorrect habits and techniques would have to be replaced by correct ones. Archery is accessible to a large range of ages, to both genders without any barrier, and also to most people who have some physical or mental impairment. The level 1 coach should be able to properly introduce any of these profiles of novice to archery. \nNovice \nExpert"}

Each level should have a justified existence with a specific definition of the different interactions between the archery/training fundamentals, the coach and the level/goal of the archer. The WORLD ARCHERY Coaching Committee considers the coach’s role as helping in the archer’s development over three steps; hence three coaching levels have been set. Level 1 This coaching level has been designed according to the usual needs of novices. Since we do not know what type of bow or which discipline the novices will choose in the future, they need to learn the common basics of archery. This allows them to be able to adapt easily to, and practice, any type of archery in the future. This means – any type of bow and in any discipline. Hence the entry level archery coach has to be trained in: • teaching • safety • equipment selection, setting and maintenance • common technical bases of archery • session preparation and management • entry level program preparation and management • connected developments • serving: o any novice: young, teenager, adult, elder, disabled o an individual novice as well as to a group of novices o in various environments: in an archery club, at school, in a community centre, in a rehabilitation centre, in a resort centre… This list is not exhaustive. It is also important to remember that at the novice level, the coach can, and will, meet different kinds of potential archers, defining the two main categories of students: 1) People approaching archery mainly for fun or as a recreational/social pastime. 2) People approaching archery as a sporting discipline. \nLevel 2 This coaching level has been designed according to the usual needs of the archers who have completed the level one program and who have decided which bow and optionally which archery discipline they will shoot. Hence the coach’s task is to improve a person’s archery skills in one or two archery “specialities”, which would be in a combination of Bow divisions and Disciplines. Level 2 mainly provides technical knowledge. At this intermediate level, it is important to realise that some archers will turn to recreational archery and some to competitive shooting. Level 3 At this level coaches are responsible for coaching/managing archers who have decided to specialize in one or two archery disciplines, who are dedicated and are striving to perform to the best of their ability, many of whom will have the ambition of representing their country at the international level. For some strong clubs and/or Provincial archery associations it could be at the provincial and/or National levels. Some of these archers will progress into professional/semi-professional training, i.e. more than one session per day, but most will be dedicated amateurs training up to 5 or 6 times a week. Whatever their status the archers at this level need some coaching assistance in several areas such as: • Training plan • Connected developments • Preparation of important events • Fine tuning of the equipment This list is not exhaustive This manual will only refer to Level 1 Efficiency of the program and the trained coach The content of this manual strives to suggest how to improve the coaching skills of those in charge of novice archers. Coach efficiency can be achieved through: • A good initial coaching education consisting mostly of a coaching course alternating between theory and practical education. It is usually conducted over several (approximately 4) week-ends or several days in a row (at least 7), with an evaluation of each candidate at the end of the course. • Continuing education which can be proposed by an archery organization, an organization of generic sport, etc. but must also be the responsibility of every archery coach."}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0023", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 22, "page_start": 23, "page_end": 23, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  23 \n  \nThis second pillar of coaching education is particularly important since we are referring to a very long lasting process. A 2007 survey showed that an average of 7 years was required to bring a novice to a world elite level (for those who were “lucky enough” to reach that level). For a high level archery coach, the development period is even longer. Hence becoming certified after a week of training does not mean that now this person is instantly a good archery coach. It just acknowledges the good disposition of the new trainer to become a good archery coach, but there is still a long road ahead. What is a good/efficient coach? Of course each level has its specific goals as outlined above. For the level 1 archery coach there are some priorities such as safe practice, social integration, basic archery skills, etc. Beyond that, one can generalize that a good/efficient coach helps their student(s) progress; not only with sport specific performance, but also with themselves and their personality. Also, we should keep in mind that one of the most important objectives for an archery club is to get archers who progress to the regional archery elite. The same applies to the Provincial/State Archery Association for the national level and to the National Archery Federation for the international level. “Being a good coach is not enough to get good results” Experience shows that there are several “good” coaches who are not “efficient”, since they do not produce top archers. While some “average” level coaches get excellent results. These two contradictory situations seem to be due to the sporting/working environment. Thus we have written down below the usual components of an efficient working environment for an archery coach. CRITERIA FOR EFFICIENCY IN THE SPORT OF ARCHERY: 1) Efficient coaching assistance. 2) High level training services and access. 3) Broad network of competitions. 4) Good administration. 5) Contracts of objectives/services between the club, the archer and the coach. We strongly invite any archery coach, including level 1 coaches (even though this matter is \nmore appropriate for level 2 and 3 coaches) to also contribute in improving these criteria in addition to their own coaching/technical skills. See below some details on these criteria. Criteria 1: Efficient Coaching Assistance. • A good initial Coaching Certification Program; • A strong continuing Coaching Education Program; • Available access to professional coaches; • Coaching assistance commensurate with the needs of the archers at their various development steps; This list is not exhaustive Criteria 2: High level Training services and access. Among others: • Good archery facilities and equipment; • Accessible archery facilities throughout the year; • Adapted to the schedule and commitments of work/school; • Generic sport facilities such as gymnasium, strengthening room, swimming pool, etc.; • Support staff in generic sport development: strengthening, psychology, medical assistance, etc.; Criteria 3: Broad Network of competitions. • Tournaments of various competitive levels to fit the archer’s current competitive level; • Tournaments of different organizational standards to prepare the archers for any competition level; • Access to many tournaments, to allow personalized schedule of competitions; • Skilled Judges; • Fair (clean) competition; Among other things. Criteria 4: Good Administration. In any organization, there is no lasting efficiency without a good administrative management. • Fair and understandable decision-making processes; • Good communication at all levels; • Transparency in all activities; • Budget management skills; This list is not exhaustive Criteria 5: Contracts of Objectives & Services."}

Once the athlete has committed to a path of excellence, a contract can define the goals and conditions of partnership between the Athlete, Association/Federation, Coach, etc. This document outlines what happens in the case of the achievement of failure of prepared objectives, among other things. Your time and energy to contribute in improving the above criteria of an efficient working environment for an archery coach, will pay back. We would like to encourage all coaches to read this manual and to use it as a main tool in their coaching activities. Enjoy your reading!\n\nCOACHING MANUAL \n   \n   25 \nTERMINOLOGY / GLOSSARY Actual draw length: The personal draw length of the archer measured at full draw, from the bottom of the slot in the nock to the pivot point of the grip plus 1 3/4 inch (45mm), which is the back edge (far side of the bow) on most bows. Actual arrow length: The personal arrow length of the archer, measured from the bottom slot of the nock to the end of the shaft (this measurement does not include the point/pile); with this end of the shaft at 1 inch (25mm) in front of the vertical passing through the deepest point of the bow grip or the arrow rest. Actual draw weight: The energy required to draw the bow to the actual draw length (commonly measured in pounds). Anchor point: A location on the archer's face to where the string hand comes to rest at full draw to give consistency to shooting. Also known as “reference point” or “facial marks”. Apache method: Aiming method along the arrow shaft Arbalest: (1) A mechanically hand wound crossbow. (2) A person who shoots a crossbow. Archer: A person who shoots a bow and arrow. Archer’s paradox: The initial stages of flight in which the arrow flexes to clear the bow handle. Arm guard: A protective shield, usually of leather or plastic, worn on the inner side of the forearm of the bow arm. It protects the arm from being hit by the bow string. Many different designs and types of arm guard can be found Arrow: A projectile shot from a bow. Arrow plate: An attachment on the side of the bow to give single point contact to the arrow and provide smooth arrow passage. Not in common use today.

The archer’s task \n   1.1.1. Physical task Archery consists of shooting arrows with accuracy and consistency to the centre of a target. To give a simplified physical view, the archer's task is to: • Repeat an action that will consistently place the arrow in the same spatial position. • Provide an equal “push” to the arrow shot after shot. \n In other words, arrow after arrow, the novice has to: • Recreate an identical body posture; hence to repeat: o All the actions that are required to reach the stage of releasing the string o The positioning of all the parts of the body in relation to the target • Release the string in an identical way. To achieve this twofold process, the novice has to repeat multiple tasks and do them correctly, which will help to make it easier to reproduce them accurately. To establish correct shooting technique the novice has to consider not only the bow (as the source of the energy that propels the arrow) but also the consistent body alignment and repetition of all the other required actions. Only strict attention to these points will result in consistent arrow flight, and thus accuracy. \n Coaches often begin by helping the novice to develop and repeat a shooting sequence. For this purpose this manual describes the most popular techniques used today, which coaches can use to build an efficient shooting sequence. In this manual we have mainly used the “shaft aiming” or “straight line aiming” technique. In this method the bow does not have a sight and the archer hooks the string underneath the arrow using the first three fingers of their string hand. But the archer’s task and skills are similar whatever the selected aiming technique, including the use of a sight. Technically the most important aspects to be considered are roughly outlined in the illustrations below: \n Place the three fingers on the string; also called “hooking”. The string fingers should remain stable on the string during the shooting process. \n A deep hook, allowing at full draw the string to settle deeply into the joint furthest from the hand, promotes string hand consistency. The palm should be quite relaxed, allowing the back of the hand to be flat (no bent knuckles), the thumb and little finger are to be kept relaxed."}

The body weight should be distributed evenly over the two legs, with the feet approximately shoulder width apart – in a square stance - and with less weight on the heels than on the toes. Put the bow hand on the bow grip making sure the knuckles make an approximately 30 to 45 degree angle with the riser and the elbow is rotated away from the string. The bow hand should remain stable on the bow grip during the shooting process. The bow should press along the long bones of the forearm (the forearm axis). On the pre-draw have the centre line of the body upright, with: • The shoulders aligned with the bow arm. • A straight line from the pressure point on the bow grip through the drawing fingers to the tip of the string elbow. \n The draw is achieved through a balanced action from the bow and string sides, without any change in the head and body position. Only a slight improvement of the alignment of the shoulders with the bow arm takes place. At full-draw the novice should maintain the upright body, with a straight line from the pressure point on the bow grip through the drawing fingers to the tip of the string elbow. The next two illustrations further demonstrate the proper posture."}

The string elbow is aligned with the string and the centre of the bow. Note: the lower back is flat. \n While aiming the novice must: • Either resist the spring effect of the bow (without clicker) • or, increase draw length a little (with clicker) Hence he/she has to provide an extension effort either isometrically (without any move like without a clicker) or concentrically (with move, like with clicker). During the release the only movements should be: • The bow arm extending a little toward the target. This extension should be from the follow-through activity of muscles and not be a deliberate push of the arm towards the target • The string hand moving away from the target, along the arrow axis; hence sliding along the jaw or neck (depending on the sighting technique)."}

The backward movement of the string arm is the continuation of the muscular activity from the back and posterior part of the string shoulder despite the fact that the string fingers have released the string. To achieve the above suggested technique the bio-mechanical abilities of the novice must be taken into account. The novice must be coached to the bio-mechanical attributes of their body and not to a technique they cannot physically achieve. A simplified description, such as the one above, cannot be complete. The actions repeated by the novice to draw or open their bow, not only during the draw but also during the aiming sequence must be taken into consideration. Therefore, to be more accurate, the novice should repeat the entire shooting process – which encompasses all of the shooting sequence, including all positions and actions executed by the novice when preparing for and accomplishing the shooting routine – in a regular and consistent manner. This routine will be covered in more depth later in this manual. When we consider what a novice has to do according to a simplified analysis, we can understand that a simple, easily reproducible shooting technique is most effective in giving similar results with each arrow shot. Nevertheless there are several positions and ways to open (draw) the bow and release - in other words \"shooting \ntechniques\" - that can be used efficiently in archery. What is important is the quality of the repetition, not necessarily the technical attributes of the novice, providing that the fundamental actions are realized correctly by the archer. 1.1.2. The Coordination of the archer Accurate aiming does not guarantee a good shot! A misconception of most novices is “I have to aim accurately at the centre of the target to get my arrow there”. Any experienced archer, know well that precise aiming cannot guarantee a good score. A good shooting action and an efficient shooting sequence involve the interaction of input and impressions from different senses. These sensations and reactions include the visual picture of the sight, the feel of the body, the mental state and an awareness of the environment. The novice has to consider all of these factors and should release the arrow only when satisfied that each one has reached an optimal stage. The way a shot feels is important as the novice cannot see himself and has to rely on the feedback from muscles to evaluate each shot. Each of the above can be considered as: • Visual picture or references: what the novice can see, such as the sight floating in an acceptable zone over the centre of the target face, the string alignment and the bow held in a vertical position • Feel / FEELING references: what the novice can feel during the whole shooting sequence (from the start of the draw until after the release), from two sources: o Physical: the sensations related to movements, body position and stability such as balance, body alignment, head position, positioning on facial marks/anchor point, draw effort with tension and relaxation. This is an important component of good shooting o Mental state: confidence, concentration and focus, freedom from distractions, stress level \nLooking from behind; the bow should be vertical, with the shoulders and hips in line with the target. The string elbow is aligned with the string and the bow. Note: the lower back is flat."}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0037", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 36, "page_start": 37, "page_end": 37, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n   \n  37 \n• Awareness – of the environment, safety, competition timing The interaction of all of these physical, mental and awareness senses are illustrated graphically below. \n The coach will help the novice to identify, develop and organize all the necessary feelings and all types of sensations: joints and body position, relaxation level, body balance, stress level and confidence level, etcetera. The visual picture and visual awareness of the environment will interact with the physical and mental feel of the archer’s body. It is important to start coaching the novice toward the development and enhancement of the body and joint positions, body balance, and the archers’ strength, keeping in mind the biomechanical structure of the archer. Once the novice is aware of what these factors are, what their impacts can be and is able to then combine them into a consistently repeated shooting sequence, they will have to learn to release the string during the time that all of them are close to ideal \n When the optimal interactive position has been reached, the arrow is released. To release the arrow before the optimal position has been established will not result in a good shot and is likely to lead to the development of faults in style. The more stable novices are in their stance and the stronger they are at full draw, the visual-motor (or vision-feeling) coordination whilst aiming occurs more often and lasts longer when it does occur. The result is that the novices can release with more confidence and control. Confidence and control are two important criteria of success in many activities. If the novice is weak and unstable they may not be able to produce or maintain this feeling of the coordination of factors. A release executed only on the visual references (aiming) will rapidly lead the novice into \"Target Panic\"; a serious problem that will be covered later in this manual. During and after the release, the archer must follow-through, maintaining the body position and other visual and physical sensations. The follow-through is an important part of the shot and the arrow is only considered shot well when the follow-through has been accomplished correctly."}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0038", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 37, "page_start": 38, "page_end": 38, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n   \n  38 \n The Release must be done WHILE MAINTAINING the quality of the motor-visual coordination. The release should only occur during the archer's visual and feeling coordination range. During the release process the quality of the vision-feeling combination of the novice should be perfectly maintained, even during the acceleration and propulsion of the arrow by the string. The shot must be controlled and orientated toward the centre of the target. Hence the novice must strive to maintain the harmony of vision and feeling. In other words: a perfect continuity of all the archer's skills (mental, physical, visual and respiratory) must be ensured during the release of the arrow until it has completely left the bow. A subconscious or automated release contributes to maintaining the quality of the vision-feeling combination of the novice during the release of the arrow and through its initial stages of flight. Whatever the natural skill of a person, experience has shown that almost anyone can become a good archer provided much well-structured practice is done. Thus the novice must be attentive in their practice and perform the above tasks consistently in order to improve as an archer. 1.1.3. Another task of the archer: force production As in many sports there are some exertions to be made in archery. Any change in the production of these efforts (e.g. intensity, \ndirection…) will generate a different shot and thus a different impact on the target. Here are some key points in the correct production of the requisite forces. a) Repetition of the forces on the bow and the string. - Should allow the correct feel for the novice to be established - Some force is required to use a bow but there should be minimal body tension. - Like in any activity with an apparatus, the coach will teach the beginner to be relaxed on this device - Usage of the arm muscles should be kept to a minimum - Shoulder and back muscles should be used for drawing the bow and extending prior to the release - While at “full draw” the extension should come from scapular motion (not the arms or hands) \n \n Side of the bow arm for right handed archer b) Force alignment • The novice must align the body and shoulder girdle correctly to produce a consistent draw length. • Correct body alignment helps reduce the onset of fatigue. c) The angles to be considered for correct body alignment Because the riser and the string apply opposed forces in the “shooting plane”, the novice must also provide efforts on \nThe Serratus Anterior muscle controls the scapula when extending prior to the release."}

Doing so as close to the plane of bow’s forces as possible is called being “aligned”. \n • Angle 1, the angle between the bow arm and the power line should be kept to a minimum, bearing in mind good string clearance. • Angle 2, the angle between the bow arm and the shoulders should be as close to 180 degrees as possible to get maximum power in the bow shoulder. • Angle 3, will depend on the length of the archer’s string side upper arm and forearm. It is not so important but if possible it should be kept to a minimum that the body will allow. • Angle 4, this should be kept as small as possible. It is important to maintain the power line from the pressure point on the bow grip through the drawing fingers to the tip of the drawing elbow to ensure an efficient release and follow-through. • Angle 5, this should be as close to 180 as possible, the back of the hand should be straight and in line with the power line. This will ensure there is no torque applied to the string during the expansion phase. This body/bone alignment allows for less muscular activity to handle the bow weight. Muscles are therefore more available for control and stability purposes (see the next section “Stable efforts”). This alignment also contributes to a proper direction of the string, particularly upon release. Nevertheless this body alignment could be an issue for the string clearance. The coach should assist the novice to encounter the best compromise in this matter (techniques to handle this compromise are given in this manual). d) Stable efforts Since archery is based on accuracy and stability, the coach has to assist novices to generate stable efforts. This can be achieved through a combination of technical developments and strength development. A novice using a low percentage of his/her strength is usually \nmuch more stable than a novice using a high percentage of his/her strength. Hence a high strength potential has to be developed. The above points make up the technique, which is mastered by repetition. Some people say “as long as you do the same thing time after time almost anything can work”. However, the wrong use of the body can introduce errors even if repeated consistently. In fact, to repeat a wrong action does not necessarily mean to obtain good results. Novices must perform each action correctly and only a very intense repetition training routine can reduce the number of conscious controls: this is known as “automation induced by muscle memory”. \n \n  \nAngle 5 \nAngle 2 \nAngle 4 \nAngle 3 \nAngle 1"}

The archer’s skills The skill of the novice is not in shooting one arrow correctly, but to repeat it time after time. The only way this can be achieved is to train the body and mind of the novice to accurately repeat a shooting routine, even under fatigue and/or stress. The areas to be considered when training to do this multi-functional task are: • Strength: to operate the bow without any stress or strain. • Static Stability: to be able to keep a stable stance while shooting. • Dynamic Stability: to be steady while aiming (no tremor in the upper body at full draw). • Visual Focus: to be able to stay visually focused no matter what distractions may occur. • Mental Focus: to be able to stay mentally focused on the task at hand under all conditions. • Inner Body Feeling: to be aware of the total and correct feel of shooting the bow and, therefore, of any position, movement and effort generated in the body during the shooting process. In addition to the above requirements the following points need consideration if the novice is to have a complete training routine. • Psychology: to keep the mind focused on the task at hand. • Relaxation: to be able to keep calm in stressful situations. • Concentration: to be able to ward off irrelevant distractions when performing. • Positivism: being confident that he/she will perform well no matter what situation may occur. Also, short term and long term goals are essential for planning progress. These goals help in the development of all archers whatever their level of expertise. Whatever goals are set they must be: Specific Measurable Achievable Realistic Timed Exciting Recorded \nIn conclusion a coach is responsible to develop several habits in each athlete they work with. The level 1 coach assists the beginner in the consistent repetition of a shooting sequence built on biomechanical principles. A strong foundation is designed to achieve this consistency under the load of bow weight. Strength, stability, inner body feeling, mental focus and concentration, and relaxation are other components that are developed as a part of the program. A coach works with both body and mind to develop a better person as well as an efficient athlete."}

It is very important that everyone teaching people to shoot thinks about safety. This section of the manual will help you to keep everyone safe while teaching them to shoot. 2.1. Planning 2.1.1. Facilities Before starting each teaching session you should check the area to be used to make sure it is safe for you, for the people you are teaching and any other people who happen to be near you. If shooting outdoors: ! Check the area to see that no one could walk into the shooting range area, put up “warning” or “keep out” signs, or flags, and if possible, fence off the area; ! Make certain there is plenty of space (at least 30m, ideally 50m) behind the butts for any arrows that miss the target. If this space is not possible, use a high bank behind the butts or put up straw bales or something similar to prevent arrows from flying too far; ! If the ground is very hard put straw, leaves or something similar to protect the arrows and stop them from bouncing too far; \n ! Make sure the ground has no holes or other hazards that people may fall over and injure themselves; ! Have the target butts firmly fixed into the ground so they do not fall over when the arrows are pulled out; \n! Keep all spectators 10 meters behind the shooting line and make sure all young children are supervised by their parents. If shooting indoors: \n ! Make certain the doors that people could come through at a level with or in front of the shooting line are closed and have “keep out” signs on the outside. Some of these doors may be emergency exits so keep these clear in case use is required; ! Make sure the butts are firmly fixed to the wall or weighted to the floor so they do not fall over when the arrows are pulled out; ! To prevent damage to the arrows, bouncing back off the wall or damaging the walls, make sure the area above, below and to the sides of the butts are covered; \n ! If netting is being used to stop arrows, make sure it is properly installed (see chapter 9 Facilities-Equipment) ! Keep all spectators 10 meters behind the shooting line and make sure all young children are supervised."}

Emergency action plan: Although serious injuries or accidents are very rare, you must be ready to deal with them if any such accidents do occur. If at all possible, have someone at the range that has formal training in first aid and CPR. Develop an Emergency Action Plan and write it down so everyone knows what they have to do in case of an emergency. Include how to get medical help, any telephone numbers to call, where to find a telephone and the names of the people who are able to carry out first aid while waiting for medical help. Put this important document where it can always be seen, and keep a copy in the First Aid Kit. 2.1.3. First aid: The basic rule of first aid for a sports injury is RICE. R – Rest. I - Ice or cold water is used for cooling the injured area and to prevent inflammation. C - Compression/pressure to reduce the blood flow to the injured area. E - Elevation/raise the injured part to help prevent swelling. Every range should have a first aid kit. Talk to your nearest medical centre or nurse to help you put together a proper kit. A simple first aid kit might contain the following: ! Blunt ended or bandage scissors; ! Safety pins in various sizes; ! Bandages - crepe and tubular in various sizes (ask your pharmacy or medical centre); ! Zinc oxide strapping for securing bandages, and strapping joints; ! Gauze swabs, Cotton swabs/Cotton balls; ! Cleansing tissues; ! Self-adhesive strip dressings, Athletic tape/adhesive tape; ! Antiseptic ointment; ! Orthopaedic felt or foam pads (can be cut to shape) - for sore feet; ! Instant cold packs or cold spray (ask your chemist or medical centre); ! Petroleum Jelly; ! Eye patches; ! Insect repellent; ! Towel; ! Latex gloves; ! Plastic bags; ! Access to a communication system for contacting specialized assistance; ! First aid manual Make sure there is always someone around who can do first aid. Don't have anything in your \nfirst aid kit that the first aider does not know how to use. Remember that first aid is exactly what its name says: FIRST AID - seek medical advice if the injury is anything more than minor. Make sure EVERYONE knows where the first aid kit is kept. Do not allow the contents of the first aid kit to be used for anything except first aid. When you use the kit make sure you replace what is used. Regularly check the items in your kit and remember to restock them before they are used up or when they are out of date. When using an ice pack, make sure it is not put directly onto the skin or you may cause a cold burn; wrap it in a small towel or cloth before applying it to the affected area. If no ice is available a cloth soaked in cold water could be used. 2.1.4. Archery site Draw a detailed plan of the site where the archery classes will be held. Indicate emergency phone numbers, where the first aid kit is kept, the route that the medical staff should follow in case of an emergency and all other details that you consider useful such as relevant mobile phone numbers and the names of the people in charge of the archery lessons, location of the nearest hospital. 2.2. Group safety 2.2.1. Planning All shooting must be under the direct supervision of one coach or other identified person whose duty is to control the shooting of the group. He/she signals the start of shooting, the end of shooting and when archers are allowed to go to the target to collect their arrows. Make sure you have adequate supervision. If at all possible a 1:6 coach to archer ratio is ideal, up to a maximum of 1:12. The shooting line should be straight, not staggered. If you have archers shooting at different distances, put the targets at the distances being shot and have everyone shoot from the same straight line."}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0043", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 42, "page_start": 43, "page_end": 43, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n   \n  43 \n A single shooting line helps make the shooting range safe. Have a whistle to control the shooting and make sure that everyone can hear it. Make sure you use the same signal each time you want the archers to carry out a particular task, for example 1 whistle to start shooting; 3 whistles to collect the arrows. \n Keep archers as well spaced as possible, no more than 2 people per target is good but definitely do not have more than 3 persons per target shooting at the same time. Keep all of the equipment in good condition, it must be inspected often and repaired as necessary. 2.2.2. The lesson The first things to tell your beginner group are the safety rules: • Do not touch equipment until told to so by the instructor; • Do not put an arrow in the bow until standing on the shooting line and facing the target; • Do not raise the bow or shoot an arrow until told to (voice command or 1 whistle); • Never shoot if there is anyone in front of the shooting line (including behind the target); • Do not raise the bow hand higher than the hand drawing the string; \n • If an arrow drops in front of the archer it must be left there until after the 3 whistles to collect arrows has been given, never move forward of the shooting line while shooting is still taking place; • When pulling arrows out of the target be careful that no-one is standing directly in line and could be hit with the nock end of the arrow as it is withdrawn from the target; • If there are more than 3 blasts of the whistle this means there is some danger, STOP SHOOTING IMMEDIATELY. Take any arrows out of the bow and return them to the quiver until there is a signal to recommence shooting. • All archers must have one foot on either side of the shooting line or have both feet on the line. • If people are shooting from a wheelchair there should usually be one large wheel and one small wheel on each side of the line. Make sure the wheelchair brake is on. • Archers should stand in a direct line with the target they will be shooting on, do not shoot diagonally across the path of arrows of someone shooting next to you. • Keep the bow vertical when loading the arrow and after shooting the arrow. Do not swing the bow sideways at any time. • Always take care on the line so you do not disturb other people still shooting. • When archers have finished shooting all their arrows, they should put their bow against the bow stand and step back behind the waiting line. • If people are behind the target looking for arrows that have missed, have one member of the group stay in front of the target so that everyone knows shooting cannot start."}

Personal safety Many archers do not concern themselves enough with their own safety while handling archery equipment. Let's look at some things that can prevent injury: ! A proper warm up should be the start of each shooting session to prevent muscle damage. ! Flat-soled shoes should be worn on the range to provide a firm foot position that is repeated every time. For competitions, shoes that cover the whole foot must be worn ! Stringing a bow, if done incorrectly, can cause serious injury. Bows should be strung before the first few teaching sessions begin and then the correct way to string a bow should be carefully taught; ! Strings that are too long or too short for the bow are dangerous and must be replaced as well as strings that are fraying; especially if the fraying is around the top or bottom tips of the bow; ! Armguards and finger tabs must fit the user to prevent injury; ! Releasing the string without an arrow can damage the bow and cause injury; a bow should never be dry-fired. \n ! Damaged equipment such as twisted limbs, cracked bows or arrows, loose or cracked nocks or loose points, must not be used until they have been repaired or replaced; ! Arrow length is very important. To start with, they should be long. If they are too short they can be overdrawn just before release and can hit the bow and break, or go through the archer's bow hand; ! The feet, body, and head positions must be suitable for each archer to have a clear string release so that there is no damage to the bow arm, face or chest, particularly women’s chests; ! Strings can catch on clothing and cause damage and/or the arrow to miss the target. Sleeves should be tight or fastened at the back of the arm, chest pockets should be emptied, and if possible covered, caps turned to the back and any badges, jewellery, and \netc. that may catch the string must be removed. It may be necessary to tie back long hair; ! If possible, belt quivers to hold the arrows should be used but if they are not available, arrows must always be carried points down to the ground. Ground quivers can also be used to hold arrows. Never allow people to run with arrows in their hands; ! Wherever you are shooting, a cardboard cylinder fixed to a bow-stand, or something similar will keep the arrows safely pointing downwards. Also, the bows can be rested against them when not in use, so the equipment is safe and people will not get hurt by falling over it. ! When walking to the target, keep a look out for arrows that did not reach the target. Collect and take them to the target or return them to their owner when possible; ! Make certain you find all arrows before leaving the ground so later users are not hurt by them. \n ! It is important that people who have been injured or ill are fully fit before returning to shooting and they should begin slowly, shooting only a few arrows and building up to shooting the full number over a period of time. 2.4. Equipment safety In the above list of prevention of human wounds, there are also some elements concerning the equipment, such as stringing the bow, releasing the string without an arrow… Sometimes arrows do not stick into the target properly and hang down across the target. If shooting continues, other arrows could hit the hanging arrow, damage both arrows and/or bounce off and not score any points. As soon as you see an arrow hanging on your target,"}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0045", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 44, "page_start": 45, "page_end": 45, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n   \n  45 \neveryone on the target should stop shooting and inform the person controlling the shooting. The controller should wait till everyone else has finished shooting on the other targets then go down to the target with the hanging arrow with just those archers, score all the arrows in the target (if any scoring is taking place), remove the hanging arrow, and place it at the back of the target. The archers on the target with hanging arrow can then return to the shooting line, finish shooting their arrows and then everyone goes to collect their arrows. To recuperate an arrow from the grass: 1) Clear the fletching area. 2) Pull backward the arrow in its horizontal axis (level with the ground). 3) Only when the whole shaft is cleared and visible, to lift it up. 2.5. Range etiquette When shooting is taking place it is important that other archers are not disturbed. Train the archers to be considerate to others on the line. This includes: ! Not talking or laughing loudly. ! Not giving advice to others on the line. ! Not criticizing out loud their own shooting performance or that of others. ! If an archer has a problem, have him move back off the line and seek help rather than asking the archer nearest to him for advice. ! When the archer has finished shooting, let him leave the line while the other archers finish theirs. ! Not touching other people’s equipment without getting their permission. ! Not removing other archers’ arrows from the target unless the owner has given permission to do so. ! Being careful of the other arrows in the target when they remove their own. ! Being totally honest when calling the arrow values, whether they are theirs or other archers’ arrows on the target. If they are not certain of the arrow value, have them ask the others on the target for confirmation. \n ! Being careful and totally honest when writing and adding the arrow totals. ! Being pleasant to other people, being a good sport. \n ! Many jobs have to be done to ensure archers are able to shoot their arrows in practice and in tournaments. Always be prepared to help the officials before and after the shooting. ! Remember alcohol and archery don’t go together. Never permit alcoholic beverages on the range or before a shoot. Anyone who has been drinking alcohol must not be allowed to shoot. ! Smoking is not permitted in or around the athletes’ area. Many places do not permit smoking at all; so make sure you know the rules where you are going to shoot. In conclusion: Safety is a key concern when participating in any sport. Being mindful of the potential hazards involved helps keep any risk to a minimum. Whether it be personal safety, equipment care, awareness of first aid procedures or general shooting etiquette, all archers should take the proper measures at the range. In so doing they will ensure a safe and enjoyable sporting experience for all."}

An efficient organization requires good administration and management including: • A comprehensive and fair decision process • Good communication at all levels • Transparency of all activities • Good budget management • This list is not exhaustive Hence a level 1 archery coach must collaborate with the elected and/or key persons from their archery organization, to contribute to the good of the overall administration structure. As a coach, you play a critical role in helping novices enjoy their involvement in sport. To make sport fun for everyone, you need to understand how novices grow and develop, how they communicate with one another, and what motivates them to come back for more. This manual gives you a summary of the skills and knowledge you need to be an effective coach. Archery is widely recognized as a good physical and mental exercise which is ever increasing in popularity as a sport for all ages. People participate in archery for various reasons. They enjoy learning new skills, and testing these skills against others. They like the challenge and excitement inherent in the sport. Winning is important, but archery allows the simple pleasures people get from being active, being with friends and just being part of archery! The approach you take to coaching should reflect these desires. You're on the right track if you concentrate on fun and teaching the fundamentals. • Fun: Make it a great experience for all beginners (see the chapter on \"Games\"). • Teaching fundamentals: Focus on the basics. As novices learn and develop their skills, their enjoyment of the sport will grow. A well prepared training session can make archery coaching a positive and enjoyable experience. An archery coach should encourage more people to make sport and recreation an integral part of their daily lives, and look upon archery as a lifetime sport. \n Here is a brief summary of some of the major coaching principles covered in this manual. You could call it the “Coach's Creed:” • Safety first • Be ready, willing, and able to help your novices develop to their full potential while recognizing their differences. They come from different backgrounds, are born with different talents, and grow and develop at different rates. • Discuss with novices and developing archers what their ambitions are, help them set realistic goals based on each person’s stage of growth and development. • Lead by example. Teach and demonstrate self-discipline, co-operation, fairness, and respect for officials and opponents. • Emphasize challenge and fun. Learning new skills and techniques can be fun when introduced through active drills and competitions. • Be flexible and willing to learn as you develop your skills as a coach. Don't be afraid to make mistakes or to ask for help when you need it. • Keep things in perspective. Make sure the time commitment required of your novices is reasonable. They are individuals first and archers second. • Fair Play: do not show favouritism, always be honest and treat your archers with the same respect that you yourself would expect."}

Your role as an archery coach The level 1 archery coach should help the archers in their own development, particularly in three areas: • Environment: safety, social (club integration), fun, fair-play, and so on. • Development: physical, technical and psychological. • Equipment: selection, set-up and maintenance. Coaching is for anyone who enjoys archery, cares about people and wishes to share this passion. It is for high school athletes, women and men, parents and grandparents. What does it take to coach? It takes people who are sensitive and caring, who are organized, who want to work with others, and who will teach from the heart. Coaches are people who love archery and want to pass on their knowledge. \n When working with your novices, you should remember that you are a teacher, a leader, and a counsellor. As a teacher, you: • Provide simple essential teaching points to help your novices learn; • Encourage skill development through different teaching and effective learning situations; • Provide lots of activity contributing to an active lifestyle of the beginners. As a leader, you: • Make archery a positive and enjoyable activity to do; • Set goals that are challenging but realistic; • Offer encouragement and support to help your novices be the best they can be; • Instil the importance of being a good sport and playing fair; \n• Respect each individual's rights and wishes, never humiliate a novice or chastise them in front of others; • Facilitate the integration of all novices’ into the class, club, etc. (Facilities, people, internal regulations and so on) until they feel part of the social group. \n As a counsellor, you: • Listen to your novices' concerns and deal with them as best you can by being supportive; • Respect the needs and confidentiality of each individual. As a technical resource, you: • Should have a good understanding and experience of the discipline before starting to coach; • Should not be satisfied with knowing just what you intend to teach novices; • Make a study of archery's history; • Should keep current with new advances in the field. This manual will be of assistance to all those who teach and are taught the art of shooting the bow. Nevertheless prior education in archery is required to be able to coach effectively. When you coach, the results are real and could be immediate. You share the small victories as novices develop skills. You feel it in their energy and enthusiasm. You see it in their smiles. But the results of coaching are also subtle and could have long term effects, too. Through archery, you will help your novices to grow and develop as individuals. The archery skills they learn from you may only be used for a few years. But the aptitudes and the attitudes they develop toward themselves and others will last a lifetime. These benefits do not come easily. There is a significant time commitment involved in being a coach – for planning, practices, and competitions - and there is a real responsibility as you enter the lives of young people. But the effort is worth it. Ask long-time coaches about"}

One of your first tasks is to point out the advantages of learning. You must show your students that they have \"a need to know\" and will benefit in direct proportion to the effort they put into it. \nCoach/Athlete Responsible Model The graphic above depicts the relationship between you - the coach (*) and the archer over time. When the individual begins archery, you are responsible to provide considerable guidance and direction as the novice acquires sport skills and learns the rules and conduct for competition. As time passes the archer will gain experience and their responsibilities and involvement will change as their development progresses. The WA Coaches Committee considers that the archery coach must help the archers in their personal development; hence the coach must give some responsibilities and leadership to the archer in the athlete-coach partnership. For that purpose the coach must mainly: • Analyse: the archer’s skills, behaviour, fitness, mind-set, etc. • Provide feedback • Propose individualized techniques, training plans, exercises, approaches, etc. The share of responsibilities and leadership of the athlete will grow over time. (*) The above graph also shows the importance of a good harmony in coaching ways, style, etc. among all coaches, allowing a successful transition for the developing archer from one step/coach to another. Any drastic conceptual coaching changes during these transitions could: o confuse the archer; o require a long adaptation time for the archer to recover some efficiency (if any) within the new coaching way; \no generate some comparison and tension among the coaches. In these ways, disparate coaching styles could be damaging for the archer’s development and for the training environment. 3.2. Coaching qualities The qualities necessary to make a success of any instructional program are many and varied. Each of us possesses some or all of these qualities to different degrees, so it is up to you to evaluate your knowledge or ability and add to it where necessary. 3.2.1. Technical knowledge Know the material you are about to use, otherwise it will be impossible to teach it to others. • Keep up with current archery developments in technology; • Ensure your knowledge of current rules is up-to-date; • Don't rely on reputation or past performance. 3.2.2. Personality Where people must work together, compatible personalities are essential for success. There are many things about an individual's personality to which others respond favourably or unfavourably. Concentrating on and improving one's own specific qualities should develop a likeable disposition. By observing other coaches and weighing up their characteristics, we can adopt those that contribute to successful teaching, while avoiding those that do not. However, be yourself. Do not be artificial. Sincerity is of prime importance. Be alert to personal appearance. 3.2.2.1. Sincerity After the knowledge of the topic, the most important factor is sincerity. At all times be natural, be sincere and enjoy your experiences while presenting your material. If you are sincere, you will express the concepts fluently and clearly and you will find that you will be accepted more readily. Avoid “putting on a show.” Your audience is more concerned with the material than your presentation."}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0049", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 48, "page_start": 49, "page_end": 49, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  49 \n  \n3.2.2.2. Sincerity of purpose Sincerity of purpose, punctuality and neatness are high on the scale of the coach's requirements. These aspects contribute considerably to the novice's evaluation of you and reflect in the attention shown during the presentations. You must be natural; sincerity is fundamental. 3.2.2.3. Attitude toward the group You must strive for additional knowledge and improved teaching abilities. A coach should have an interest in class members and their problems. Be fair in all decisions. Your attitude influences the class morale since the class adopts both the attitudes and the point-of-view projected by the coach. Listen to your student’s point of view, their views may be different to yours and things might be learnt that have not been previously considered. 3.2.2.4. Appreciation This principle emphasizes that your real task is to train people, not just to teach subject matter. You must be aware that novices learn many things other than the material presented. Novices, as a rule, react directly to your attitude. You must, therefore, employ a positive attitude. Refrain from making remarks or giving personal opinions that may contribute to undesirable novice attitudes. Learning is not complete until the novice has acquired the correct attitudes and habits of conduct and applies them correctly. The following check list summarizes the material discussed: • Treat learners as equals; • Discuss, do not argue; • Expect good results and give credit where due; • Keep the class alert and on its toes; • Be fair. Favouritism is divisive; • Be courteous, patient and tactful and when the need arises be humble; • Maintain poise, avoid nervous habits; • Lead, do not be forceful; • Consider first impressions; • Remember, communication is two-way; • Always have empathy with each situation; • Discipline through respect; • Know the answers - don't bluff; • Admit mistakes; You must also employ other qualities, such as being a good communicator, organizer, teacher, etc. The theory component of coaching education discusses these concepts in greater detail. \n3.2.3. Fair play Sport gives your novices a chance to experience fair play in action. Make sure that you talk to your novices about what fair play means to them. Here are some things you can do to encourage it: • Recognise and respect individual differences; • Provide equal opportunity for all to participate; • Learn and follow the rules of the game; • Encourage your novices to always do their best; • Instil a positive attitude toward competition; • Encourage your novices to be modest in victory and to be good sports in defeat. \n 3.2.4. Communicating Communication is a two-way process. Good communication leads to good understanding. In order to help your instructions to be both productive and relatively easy to carry out you should be aware of some parts of the instructional process illustrated below. 3.2.4.1. Communicating with your novices \n Communication is a two-way process"}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0050", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 49, "page_start": 50, "page_end": 50, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  50 \n  \nHere are a few simple tips to help you communicate effectively with your novices during practice and competitions: • Give them an opportunity to speak and ask questions; • Listen carefully to what they say and how they say it; • Speak to every novice at every session; • Speak to them using words they understand. Always keep it simple. \n 3.2.4.2. Speaking ability and control The coach's ability to control the group or individual starts with speaking ability. Audibility and clarity and diction are key elements to success. Firm control is very different from forceful and dogmatic insistence, which can only cause hard feelings and lack of co-operation. Be alert to your diction and voice. You can find more in the following sections.\" 3.2.4.3. Audibility You must speak loudly enough to be heard by all the novices. Speak directly toward your group in a voice loud enough for those in the back to hear clearly. Always be aware of those in the farthest corner, noting whether they are able to understand you, nevertheless your volume should not irritate those in the first row. 3.2.4.4. Clarity Articulate distinctly and take care not to slur your words. If you have an accent, try to keep your phraseology within the scope of those listening to you. Use words that they will understand. The terms used should be the same as those used in this manual, which the novices will use later to refresh their memories, and for reference. Care must be taken to ensure that you give only the details relevant to the subject under discussion. Do not confuse the issue with facts beyond what is required at that stage of learning. Remember, \"Brevity is the soul of wit.\" \n3.2.4.5. Speed For the first lessons, you should be careful to keep a slow speech rate. 140 words per minute as recognized as the upper retention limit when speaking to a group. Your speech rate may be increased in later levels when your novices are more conversant with the subject matter. Make sure you give your novices the time they need to assimilate the facts you are giving them. 3.2.4.6. Gestures If gestures come naturally to you by all means use them but try to avoid overdoing it. The overuse of any mannerism will cause irritation and diminish the effectiveness of the movement. Vary your actions, act natural and project yourself to your group. 3.2.4.7. Enthusiastic versus monotony If you are enthusiastic about your topic, your audience will be enthusiastic too, and it will excuse any weaknesses in your delivery. When speaking to any group you must be careful to keep your tone of voice flexible, avoiding the mechanical sound of the one-note level of speech. At no time should you read a prepared speech. Small cards with brief notes and headings of each of the topics you plan to deal with, will enable you to maintain a well-developed order for your presentation and prevent you from forgetting one or more sections of your subject. You should try to open your presentation with a few concise remarks outlining the material you intend to present. At the conclusion, you should briefly summarize your presentation, noting the key points, which you hope will be retained by the novices. 3.2.4.8. Repetitious phrases Most speakers tend to overuse some pet phrase. Try to avoid excessive use of such things as \"fair enough\", \"by and large\", \"you know\", and many others. Similarly, the speech fillers such as \"hum's\", \"ah's\", and \"er's\" can be quite distracting and unproductive. These useless additions only tend to irritate and distract the novice's attention from the real material being discussed."}

Humour Every good speaker knows the value of humour in relaxing his or her audience. All speeches are improved by the skilful use of suitable and tasteful anecdotes relevant to the subject material being discussed. These jokes must be used in a natural easy manner as a tense joke invariably falls flat. Always be ready to laugh at yourself if you make an amusing slip; you are not expected to be perfect. 3.2.4.10. Timing When you plan to give a talk on a topic make sure that you cover all the relevant material and leave enough time for questions. Sometimes you can get so absorbed in your talk that your forget the time or you might get side-tracked and depart from your planned material. Both can cause time problems, which may be difficult to correct when you finally realize what is happening. 3.2.5. Time management To become a good athlete, several criteria are needed, but two are fundamental: time and money. Hence the coach should assist the archer with these two matters. First let us consider the time criteria. According to some statistics made at the 2007 World Championship, it generally takes seven years to bring a novice to the world level (there are exceptions in both directions: faster and slower). A poorly organised training program would certainly make this period longer, while a well-planned training program could reduce this period. The training volume has grown a lot. Nowadays many top level archers practice 2 or 3 times per day, five or six days per week. Shooting several hundred arrows per day is very common. For the same reasons, the coach should also be an efficient time manager. The level 1 coach will strive to make the best use of the time allocated to a practice session. A novice shooting only 40 arrows during a session will certainly not benefit the same amount as another novice shooting 80 arrows in the same time. Hence a coach should always strive to provide the maximum practice time possible during each class. It is poor planning to finish a training session either early or late. Ending early can be interpreted as a lack of interest from the coach, while finishing late could give the appearance of \nnot being fully prepared for the session. Any good session must have a well-prepared outline to ensure suitable distribution of time over all the steps of your class. Novices should know what time the lesson is to end or when a break is due. Since coaching is assisting an athlete to develop various skills in a period of time, the coach should make the best use of the total available time of the archer. Hence time management, programming and planning are important coaching skills. 3.2.6. Managing the financial resources Let us now consider the second fundamental criterion to becoming a good athlete: money. There is no efficient organization without good administration. This is valid for a sport club as well. Good administration includes good budget management. Archery, like all sports, comes with a specific cost: the price of equipment; not only the shooting gear, but also the target requirements and the club uniform (if any). Transportation to practice and tournaments as well as registration fees also contribute to the budget. Additionally, to properly instruct, a coach needs teaching tools, elastics, mirrors, video, etc. Thus the management of the (usually low) budget of an archery organization must be very effective. It would be a shame to spend a significant part of a club budget on a banquet while ignoring the crucial needs above. Hence the level 1 archery club coach must assist the decision makers to make the best use of the available financial resources, and if possible help to increase them. 3.2.7. Selecting a teaching method It is important that the coach develops a coaching technique on the same level with the novices being coached. If the level is too high or too low the novice will soon lose interest and the coaching session will not be very productive. Learning the basic shooting form is quicker through the on-going correction system. When bad form is allowed to be repeated it becomes the accepted form and it is very difficult to change later. Because of this, it is generally accepted that each stage of the program should be firmly acquired by the novice before proceeding on the next stage. The World Archery Beginner Awards Program not only provides suggestions for teaching archery skills in a proper progression, but also through evaluations as it ensures each stage is firmly acquired. A final brushing up of the form can be done later as long as the basics are clear to the novice."}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0052", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 51, "page_start": 52, "page_end": 52, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  52 \n  \nAn efficient teaching method for most of the technical skills in archery, includes the visual (to see it, even to visualize it), and the feeling (identification of the perceptions). Trial and error should always be conducted under close supervision until the correct sequence of responses has been learned. Once the novice has learned the correct sequence, it can be entrenched by repetition. Repetition is the most effective way of preventing the archer from forgetting, but its use must be tempered by judgment. Prolonged repetition will produce boredom and apathy. It is better to practice one hour a day for six days, than to practice six hours in one day. This principle should be remembered when training is being conducted. It is important to maintain a high level of focus during practice. If the focus while practicing a particular form aspect deteriorates to a level where the target skill is no longer being trained effectively, the session should be stopped or a different exercise undertaken in order to maintain the novices' interest and enthusiasm. A physical involvement of the novice in his/her apprenticeship is always recommended against a passive learning: \n Coaching heavily based on oral instruction is risky as shown on the illustration below: To develop a coaching technique, the coach has to make several choices and they have to be done before starting to deliver the level 1 program. They mainly concern the following: • Safety: Most important of all. How will you ensure the safety at any time? • Skills: You have to select the skills to be developed during the level 1 program and \nset how far you want to develop them. You can refer to the World Archery Beginner Awards Program. • Demonstrations and Instructions: You must figure out how you will balance these two components of skill introduction in each session. • Teaching Method and Supports: How will you teach each skill in the program and with what (e.g. which teaching aids)? • Set-up: You have to decide the shooting distance, type and size of targets, number of arrows, duration of each step of your teaching process and of the entire session, among other choices • Observation and Feedback: You must anticipate what you wish to observe, from where, how, etc., and how you will provide feedback to your students • Implementation Assistance: Ask experienced archery coaches what the most common difficulties novices face in properly implementing the skill at hand; this will help you to learn how to best assist the novices. • Individualization: Since everyone is different, and since there are several successful archery forms and techniques, you will have to work with each novice to determine the shooting technique that should be the most efficient for him/her. 3.2.8. Managing the human resources 3.2.8.1. Managing the coach/parent/athlete relationship As a coach, you are ultimately responsible for most of the novice’s training activities. This role will be easier and more enjoyable if you recruit others to help. Experienced archers or those who are contemplating becoming a coach can be called upon to serve as an assistant coach or manager. Here are some suggested roles and responsibilities for these positions: Assistant Coach (archer contemplating becoming a coach) • Review the practice plans with the coach before each session. • Assist the coach in practices and competitions. • Run a safety check of the play area. • Assist in the maintenance of the novices' equipment. • Maintain the first aid kit. Manager (an experienced archer) • Look after the club equipment that the novices are using. • Provide information regarding practice sessions, tournaments, registration and transport. \nTELL ME……..I FORGET \nSHOW ME……..I REMEMBER INVOLVE ME ……..I UNDERSTAND \nWhat you want to say \n What you can say \n What the student hears \nWhat the student understands \n What the student remembers \nWhat the student can repeat back \nWhat you really say \nWhat the student can practically use \n 90% Loss of information"}

Tips for finding volunteers • Ask your league scheduler or club president for names of people who could assist when you are getting other information from them prior to your season. • Do not allow your lessons to be a babysitting service, do not allow \"drop off\", and solicit the involvement of the parents. • Ask neighbours and friends to help out. If not, ask them to suggest others who enjoy people and have a background in archery. • It is important as a coach to monitor the coach/parent/athlete relationship during practice. Often a parent can dominate the relationship and negate some of the progress you've made with the novice. Getting the parent involved with another novice can help, for example \"I noticed you're good at teaching_____ and little Johnny needs help with that. Could you help him,” thereby directing him away from his own child. Tips for keeping volunteers Once you've found volunteers, it's important to keep them motivated and involved. Here are some ways you can do it: • Involve them in planning wherever possible; • Have them do things they find enjoyable; • Acknowledge and thank them for their contributions; • Keep an open dialogue with parents; • As they gain experience allow them to take over some coaching duties from you; • Encourage them to take a formal coaching course; • If they don't already shoot, encourage them to learn. Meeting with novices & parents Regular meetings encourage communication and help build a positive relationship. Many coaches like to hold three meetings each season: one at the beginning, one at mid-season and one at the end. Some coaches have meetings with novices and parents together; others like to hold a separate meeting for each group. Sometimes it may be preferable to speak to novices or parents individually. The age range of your novices and the approach you like to take will determine how you handle meetings and how many you hold. Remember, much can be accomplished in brief sessions before and after practices and competitions. Parents meeting \nA meeting specifically with parents at the beginning of the season can be helpful in covering the items in the list above. Since parents are likely to have a broader scope of interest, it is a chance to go beyond and cover related topics as well. As an added bonus, it is an ideal time to recruit volunteers. For the parents this meeting provides an opportunity to interact with each other and you as the coach to see that they are entering their child into a program that they can support. Here are some additional items to cover in the parents/adults meeting: • Welcome and introductions; • Goals of the program • Roles of the various persons running the program • Novices' hopes, expectations and long term objectives; • Listen to parents' expectations; • Your coaching philosophy; • Ways parents can assist and be involved; • Schedule for practices, and competitions; • Arrangements for car-pooling or travel; • Equipment and other costs, fundraising activities; • Questions and answers; • Explanation of rules, safety, etc.; • Use of the club/school Website, Facebook and E-newsletters as source of communication; • How and when you can be contacted for follow-up. • Distribute the schedule of club events i.e. social and tournaments etcetera. Use this meeting to hand out schedules and circulate a novice's directory. Also, this is the perfect opportunity to get a novice's Medical Information Card for each student in the session. It is important to listen to parents whenever they want to talk to you about their child. It is your role to guide parents in their involvement in archery. You can do this in a number of ways: • Encourage them to acquire an understanding and appreciation of the archery through knowledge of basic rules, skills, and strategies; • Expect the same respect for fair play from them as you do from your novices; • Discourage and inform those who want to coach from the side-lines. Getting messages from others will only confuse your novices. Explain to them how they can participate in your development plan."}

A child who really doesn't want to participate in archery just now should not be forced into doing so. This will only lessen the chance of the child taking it up later and can even lead to negative feelings about sport in general. From time to time, some parents may have to be reminded that it's just a game. 3.2.9. Ethics Archery challenges everyone involved - novices, coaches, officials, and parents - to do their best honestly and fairly. Your conduct as a coach will serve as an example to others. Please refer to the World Archery Code of Ethics in the appendix as a guide for your actions as a coach. Sport gives all archers a chance to experience fair play in action. Here are some things you can do to encourage it: • Recognise and respect individual differences; • Provide equal opportunity for all to participate; • Give value to Drug Free Sport; • Learn and follow the rules of the game; • Encourage your novices to always do their best; • Instil a positive attitude toward competition; • Encourage your novices to be modest in victory and to be \"good sports\" in defeat; 3.2.10. Experience Naturally the more experienced you are, the better you will perform in front of the group. In each teaching situation you will find you are learning new phrases and methods while becoming more skilled in the use of the time at your disposal. Be aware of becoming too glib as this tends to make the whole process too automatic. It takes a long time to become a good archer; as a consequence it takes longer to become a good archery coach! 3.2.11. Self-evaluation To get progressing athletes, we need progressing coaches! \nTo progress a coach needs to get experience, continuing education, exchanges of experience and self-evaluation. You should evaluate yourself from time to time to see how you're doing as a coach. Complete the following checklist early in your season. Do it again midway through and once more at the end of the season. Some questions to ask oneself regularly. (See the Self-evaluation questionnaire below) One of the best indications of your success as a coach is the frequency of new-members or dropouts. Ask yourself why novices are dropping out: are practices boring? Are they too competitive? Is there a lack of equipment? Are your facilities unsafe? If you're a good coach you may suddenly find yourself inundated with new members as happy novices bring their friends and relatives in. Keep monitoring yourself and if you're not at the level you want to be, plan to make some changes. To help you do this, complete the following questionnaire to find the areas where change will help your development as a coach."}

Code of Ethics Note: This section repeats several topics covered elsewhere in this manual due to their overwhelming importance in coaching and the sport of archery in general. Contents: Preamble: 1. Role of the Coach: 2. Dignity: 3. Integrity in Relationships: 4. Professional Competence: 5. Personal Standards: 6. Confidentiality: 7. Coach Responsibility: 8. 1. Preamble: Coaching within the sport of archery can contribute with the development of individuals in their chosen sport. It is a process for developing many awareness skills which, when used, will enhance the archer’s ability, consistency and enjoyment of shooting the bow. Every coach should respect and protect each person’s human and civil rights, and should not participate in any unfair or discriminatory practices or condone such activities. It is essential to establish and maintain a standard of ethical behaviour whatever level of coaching is being undertaken. The coach should work within an ethical framework that is acceptable to them, the person they are coaching and the national guidelines of the country in which they are coaching. The principles of responsibility detailed in this document provide the core values for good progressive coaching. This code of ethics for coaching is a framework within which to work and lists a series of guidelines rather than a framework of rules.

How coaches communicate with the archer and the atmosphere they create often determines whether the interactive experience is beneficial or detrimental. Based on this, coaches should adopt a positive approach to coaching. This should be based on good common sense and incorporate several basic principles. 2.1 Give plenty of praise and encouragement. When people are learning and refining newly adopted skills, coaches should provide plenty of genuine praise and encouraging statements that are related to the skills and performance of the archer. 2.2 Give praise sincerely.

It is imperative that coaches and their archers have realistic expectations that are based on each individual’s abilities. 2.4 Give praise for effort as much as outcome. For some archers, winning events may be an unlikely achievement, but trying to succeed by giving maximum effort is attainable by all those involved. 2.5 Give praise for correct techniques and performance, not just outcome.

Code of Ethics Note: This section repeats several topics covered elsewhere in this manual due to their overwhelming importance in coaching and the sport of archery in general. Contents: Preamble: 1. Role of the Coach: 2. Dignity: 3. Integrity in Relationships: 4. Professional Competence: 5. Personal Standards: 6. Confidentiality: 7. Coach Responsibility: 8. 1. Preamble: Coaching within the sport of archery can contribute with the development of individuals in their chosen sport. It is a process for developing many awareness skills which, when used, will enhance the archer’s ability, consistency and enjoyment of shooting the bow. Every coach should respect and protect each person’s human and civil rights, and should not participate in any unfair or discriminatory practices or condone such activities. It is essential to establish and maintain a standard of ethical behaviour whatever level of coaching is being undertaken. The coach should work within an ethical framework that is acceptable to them, the person they are coaching and the national guidelines of the country in which they are coaching. The principles of responsibility detailed in this document provide the core values for good progressive coaching. This code of ethics for coaching is a framework within which to work and lists a series of guidelines rather than a framework of rules.

This technique focuses on providing a corrective instruction sandwiched between two positive and encouraging statements. 2.8 Help archers set realistic but challenging and attainable goals. Help archers to define success by achieving personal goals that have been set by mutual discussion and agreement. These goals should be recorded so that they can be referred to through the progression of improvement and time. 2.9 Ensure that training and practice are enjoyable and always end on a positive note. 2.10 Expect children or juniors to perform within the limits of their age, physical attributes and ability rather than as miniature adults. 3. Dignity: Safeguarding the dignity of the individual is a fundamental requirement of being a coach. 3.1 There shall be no discrimination between participants on the basis of race, sex, ethnic origin, religion, philosophical or political opinion, marital status or any areas that would be offensive or cause aggravation to any person the coach is likely to come in contact with. 3.2 No practice constituting any form of physical or mental injury to the participants will be tolerated. All doping practices at all levels are strictly prohibited. Any form of inducement to indulge in, or partake in, any drug abuse is contradictory to the Code of Conduct for Coaches. 3.3 All forms of harassment or abuse against participants or spectators; be it physical, mental, professional or sexual, are prohibited. \n4. Integrity in Relationships: Coaches must not encourage archers to violate the rules laid down by the official organisation/federation governing that activity. They should actively condemn any such action and encourage archers to adhere to, and abide by the spirit of the rules. 4.1 Coaches should not compromise their archer’s integrity by condoning any activity that would present an unfair advantage. The coach must encourage and actively pursue measures that progressively develop performance improvement in a safe and considerate manor that will not jeopardise the archers’ well-being for future performances. 4.2 It is the coaches’ responsibility to ensure training and programmes they follow are directly relevant to the archer and that they are in accordance with the age, ability and experience of the archer and will not cause any incapacitation. 4.3 The coach should be responsible for the conduct of their archers and must discourage any behaviour that would bring them, the archer or sport into disrepute, whether this is in training, travel or competition. 4.4 Coaches must treat all opponents with respect whether it is in victory or defeat, and should encourage their archers to act similarly. It is the coach’s duty to prepare their archer to respond to success and defeat in a cordial and dignified manner. 4.5 Coaches must be able to present any evidence of documented qualifications on request and must not refer to or display any item that falsely implies any sponsorship or accreditation qualifications. 5. Professional Competence: The coach should take the limits of their knowledge and capacity into account; and should not assume responsibility if they are not sufficiently prepared for the task at hand."}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0058", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 57, "page_start": 58, "page_end": 58, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  58 \n  \n5.1 The coach should recognise and accept when it is necessary or appropriate to refer their archer to other coaches or sport specific specialists for further development. It is also their responsibility, where appropriate, to verify the competence of the person or organisation to which they are referring their archer. 5.2 It is important for the coach to obtain documented evidence of their qualifications either through coach training or documented coaching performance. 5.3 The coach must refrain from working in an environment that is unsafe or jeopardises the safety, or well-being, of their archers or other participants. 5.4 Coaches should actively seek ways of improving their personal and/or professional development; they have a responsibility to themselves and their archers to improve their own ability and effectiveness. 6. Personal Standards: Personal appearance is a matter of individual preference and culture but a coach should project an image of cleanliness and efficiency; and not project an image that would offend either onlookers or the archers being coached. 6.1 Coaches must be aware of, and project an image of high standards of coaching to their archer, their archers parents and families, other coaches, spectators, officials and all other persons that may be in the vicinity or able to observe any activity being undertaken. 6.2 Coaches should never smoke when they are conducting a coaching or training session. 6.3 Coaches should not drink any alcohol before conducting a coaching session. It may affect their decisions or competence to coach and may compromise the safety of the archers or spectators of the session. It may also be offensive to archers to smell alcohol on the breath of the \nperson they are being coached by, and breathing out alcoholic fumes does not portray a very good image of a coach in charge of an important training session. 7. Confidentiality: When a coach has a good working relationship with an archer it is inevitable that a great deal of confidential information is shared and sometimes recorded. It is imperative that the coach and archer agree on which of this data is regarded as confidential, this confidential information must not be divulged to any person or persons without the express approval of the archer or their parent or guardian. Coaches must not disclose information entrusted to them in confidence. Any disclosure of information must not be for personal gain or benefit, nor be undertaken maliciously to damage the reputation of any person or organisation. Some person, persons or organisations may have a need or right to have knowledge of some of this confidential information. It may fall on the coach to decide whether the disclosure of such information is in the best interest of the archer or sporting organisation. Some examples of this are: • Performance information for team or competition selection. • Disclosure of information to doctors, athlete’s parents or family where the health or safety of the athlete may be in jeopardy. • Disclosure of information to protect children or vulnerable adults from abuse. • Disclosure of information for legal or disciplinary requirements. 8. Coach Responsibility: Responsible coaching carries the expectation that activities carried out by coaches will be beneficial to the archers they are coaching and to the sport in which they partake. The purpose of coaching is to improve the archer’s performance and at the same time minimise the risk of injury by employing up-to-date techniques and ensuring that all their training programmes are well prepared."}

They should accept the responsibility to refer their archer to other coaches or sports specific experts who have more advanced knowledge than themselves, and work with these people to enhance their archer’s well-being and/or performance. 8.2 The coach should strive to enhance their knowledge and coaching skills through research and personal learning projects, and to ensure their training programmes enhance their archer’s well-being and/or performance and does not harm or hinder them in any way. 8.3 The coach must be responsible for their archer or team and themselves in the pursuit of professional competence both in training and competition through well balanced and appropriate training programmes. 8.4 The coach must ensure that all training exercises and training programmes are appropriate for the person they have been designed for, and take into consideration, age, health, ability and experience of that person. 8.5 The coach must take into consideration the individuality and ability of each team member when constructing training exercises or training programmes. 8.6 The coach must constantly monitor their archer’s physical and mental condition, take the necessary or appropriate immediate action, and take this into consideration when overseeing training exercises or constructing training programmes. 8.7 The coach must be aware of every day pressures the archer may have, such as educational, occupational, family or financial, and adapt their actions, instructions and training programmes accordingly. 8.8 The coach must consider the archer’s well-being and future development when making decisions \non whether the archer can continue competing if suffering from a minor injury, fatigue or minor ailment. It is imperative that the well-being and future development of the archer are put before current performance. In conclusion, we hope that this chapter will help to clarify the role and responsibilities expected of an archery coach. Also, the related qualities and values that to be developed along with the expected behaviour and social interaction; in other words, all that is needed to be considered to be good archery coach."}

Preparation of a Level 1 Archery Training Program 4.1.1. Programme planning and preparation An entry-level programme is based on the teaching the steps required to shoot an arrow towards a target in the proper sequence. “Practice session sequencing” provides an example of a sequence of such steps. You can use these steps for your sessions with novices. With no further knowledge on their part you can practice archery on a recreational level with your students, always keeping safety in mind. If you want to educate your novices to perform to their highest level, you have to organise your archery programme in a structured way, to proceed step by step to the eventual best performance of your archers. As a result, your practice sessions with your novices will give both you and your students satisfaction and enjoyment. You need to set the following: • The length of the programme: - A complete beginner archery programme consists of a series of at least 15 practice sessions. • The number of practice sessions scheduled: - A novice should practice at least once a week, more is better. • Location(s), dates and starting time: - A booking process may be required. • Length of the practice sessions: - Usually an entry level archery class lasts one to two hours. • The archery equipment available: - Usually from your archery organisation or local club. • The human resources available: - Will you be alone or assisted? An experienced coach can operate with one or several assistant-coaches. • The number of novices in the course: - The size of the class depends on the ability of the coach. Ideally there is a ratio of 1 coach to 6 novice archers. - Pending the profile of the novices, the available equipment and your experience in archery coaching, 6 to 12 may be acceptable.\n • The age range of the archers: - All ages from eight and up are acceptable. However, younger archers may require more coaches • Finance/budget: - Including the financial participation of the novices. • Anything else that might pertain to your particular situation. Knowing the above elements, you can now prepare the various classes of your programme and your promotional campaign. 4.1.2. Practice session sequencing An archery programme should be structured in a methodical way. To get results, the novice first has to learn to shoot correctly. The learning process follows a natural and logical progression. In the beginning a novice often finds it difficult to find or control the muscles necessary for good posture and shot control. With training the required muscular movements will become controlled and refined. Depending on the body awareness of the novice, it may take several training sessions for the shooting sequence to become automatic. During an entry-level archery course the coach follows a systematically organized programme to teach the basic shooting skills. These skills may be taught in the following order, in the case where the program starts with the shaft aiming method (see 6.9. FACIAL MARKS OR REFERENCES): 1. Stance and Body-pre-setting 2. Hand positions 3. Bow raising 4. Pre-draw 5. Draw (Bow opening) 6. Full draw activity 7. String clearance 8. Bow hand (introduction of the sling) 9. Release 10. Follow-through With any aiming method other than using the shaft (straight line), the three following skills may be taught earlier 11. Facial marks (face/draw-hand position), also called Anchor Point 12. String alignment 13. Sight setting (use of the quadrilateral method) For all methods and techniques, finish with:"}

Final overview of the novice Note 1: Some of these basic skills may require many sessions and many different exercises. Build your own plan of teaching themes. In chapter #6, this manual will provide suggestions for teaching each of these basic themes. Note 2: In this manual we have mainly used the shaft or straight line aiming technique. But many of these basic skills are also taught when using any other aiming method from the beginning, including the use of a sight. 4.1.3. BAP, a world Archery tool to build your entry level programme from \n The World Archery Beginner Award Programme (BAP) described in chapter 13, is a great assistance to track an archer’s development. If the BAP system is not used, a bespoke file for the development for each novice can be made. Learning to shoot with a bow effectively takes time. It requires the learning and mastery of many different details and actions. Therefore, divide the total process into logical principles or steps. The progress of the novice’s development and any flaws the novice is working on can be recorded and archived. The main principles for building an entry-level programme include: • Always focussing on doing things right rather than avoiding mistakes • Assuming a proper stance and posture without a bow • Assuming the correct posture with the bow • Maintaining correct posture whilst shooting and follow through (including back tension), resulting in a passive release • Making effective use of skeletal structures (bones) instead of using muscle power • “Paying attention to what you are doing in the here and now; thinking about this step only and how to do it correctly.” • Proper evaluation considering the quality of the shot first instead of looking at the target for the results After some time the coach will find out that each novice has his/her strong and weak points. At this time the advice of the coach will become tailored to each archer’s needs. If a novice moves or gets a new coach he/she can take this chart with them and the new coach will know at what point to continue teaching. \n4.1.4. Promoting your programme Before you start an archery class or course you need to interest people in the sport of archery. A promotional campaign can be useful, and should include the programme duration, location of the facility, schedule, cost, etc. Examples of successful marketing techniques include: A promotional article in a local newspaper is often enough to garner public interest. A promotional article in a local paper. • A poster in the window or on a publication board of large stores or other public facilities. (Ask permission first.) • A small advertisement on the inside of the window of your car. • E-advertisement: Website, Social media… • A Come-and-Try event Usually people enter their name on a list if they want to attend an archery course. As them for their address or telephone number as well, in case you have to contact them, e.g. for the exact start date of the new course. You may have to make a waiting list. 4.1.5. Registration and Data Banking You, as a coach, have to keep track of all kinds of information which you can subsequently retrieve, and which may be used or needed for membership and/or during a training session. Some of this information will require regular updating as it will possibly be used for future training sessions. We call this administration activity “Data Banking.” Your database will usually be in a notebook form, or recorded electronically. Remember that information can be confidential; in some countries it is even forbidden by law to publish personal data without permission. In a later stage you might need the following information as well: • Equipment required by the archers • Equipment needed by you as the coach As a coach, ensure that you are up-to-date about insurance and liability considerations. Upon registration, inform the novices of clothing recommendations for the shooting sessions. 4.1.5.1. File of participants Preparing simple forms like a File of Participants or Participants Chart is useful for administration. Ask the novices and parents to provide the necessary information. When the directory is complete, remove any confidential or non-public information and make photocopies to give to each archer or family group. Parents often appreciate having a copy"}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0062", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 61, "page_start": 62, "page_end": 62, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  62 \n  \nso they can get to know the names of the archers their child is shooting with. The coach should know all his archers. A list of names is useful to get to know all novices by name as quickly as possible. Use a File of Participants with, among others, the following attributes: • Given name and family name • The name the novice wishes to be known as • Sex • Date of birth • Address. Useful for arranging carpools, for example • Phone number • Email address. Have a question on the intake form asking whether they mind sharing their email address with the group • Shooting side • A picture of the novice would be useful for future memory 4.1.5.2. File of equipment \n An inventory can be made so that the coach will know what equipment is available and what is still needed and should be purchased before the programme starts. It is recommended to start with no target face, but if you use any, give preference to large target faces, 80cm minimum. Don’t forget to ensure the tackle box is well filled with repair materials such as arrow rests and spare nocks, strings and dental floss or thread to make proper nocking points. Repair the equipment where necessary. And last but not least: don’t make a dustbin of your tackle box! In an Equipment File or Equipment Inventory Chart we store the information about the stock of bows, such as • Identification of bow • Left or right-hand • Bow weight • Bow length Mark the identification of the bow on the riser. You can have a similar file for the stock of arrows and other equipment such as arm guards and finger tabs as well. 4.1.5.3. Equipment assignment file \n An Equipment Assignment File or Equipment Assignment Chart is recommended. It indicates the equipment that novices use and it will include: • Name of the archer • Arrow length and size • Identification of the club equipment used \n4.1.5.4. Medical information card \n Having a Medical Information Card for each novice is important for safety. A blank novice Medical Information Card is provided at the end of this chapter. Copy the required number, and then ask parents to complete one for their child at the beginning of the programme. Review all the cards when parents return them, and ask for any additional information needed. Knowing these details helps to prevent problems and allows you to deal with injuries or accidents more effectively if they occur. Assure parents the information will be kept confidential. 4.2. Preparation of an archery class 4.2.1. Come-and-Try event versus the first class of an entry level program Below we have made suggestions for the first class of an entry level programme. For a Come-and-Try event our recommendations would be different since we have to get the participants shoot arrows within a short time. Safety is the main concern, while proper shooting from is not so important. The idea is that people shoot arrows for as long as possible and hit what they are aiming at. The shaft aiming method is particularly appropriate to a Come-and-Try event, because it is easy to hit the target at a short shooting distance with minimal technical acquisition and equipment adjustment. The first class of an entry-level programme is quite different from a Come-and-Try event. In a class, it is important to take the time to help the novice get a firm grasp of proper basic archery form. This will allow them to build efficient shooting form for however long they participate in archery. 4.2.2. Educational concept Like any training, there is in archery coaching a lasting debate on global and analytic instruction of the novice. Let us look a little at these two concepts, that have the same final goal: to teach to teach a single person a shooting sequence."}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0063", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 62, "page_start": 63, "page_end": 63, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  63 \n  \n4.2.2.1. Global learning \n A pre-determined sequence is taught to the novices. Very often it is “a movement or a path” starting from the bow elevation to the release. Its main advantages and disadvantages are: Advantages: • For the novice: - Allows an early fluid execution • For the coaches: - Only one form to be instructed; hence an easier coaching education also an easier task - Facilitate harmony among coaches Disadvantages: • This pre-determined sequence cannot fit some novices; hence some later changes may be required for customization • Some details can escape the novices 4.2.2.2. Analytic learning \n The shooting sequence is built and instructed by steps. The advantages and disadvantages are the opposite ones of the Global Learning, i.e.: Advantages: • Allows the coach to individualise/customise each component of the shooting sequence; hence the complete shooting sequence of each person • Allows the novice to understand what is important in each step Disadvantages: • Possible lack of fluidity; hence post-work on linking the steps is often required • The coach needs a strong coaching education to be able to individualise/customise while still respecting the fundamental bases In this manual we are using the analytical approach to allow the apprentice coaches to individualise and customise the shooting sequence for a potentially diverse group of beginners. Furthermore this study will augment the development of a global process of teaching archery to novices. \n Individual steps learned analytically are joined to form a complete shooting sequence. In fact even each piece of the above sequence/puzzle is made of various pieces of puzzle. These pieces and “sub-pieces” are detailed in chapter 6 of this manual. Similar to the common technique of assembling a puzzle by starting with the edge pieces, the various archery classes provide a structure to organizing the instruction and development of novices. Nevertheless, in the same way we sometimes find a piece of the puzzle that fits inside the puzzle frame, one can have a novice implementing some skills correctly that we have scheduled to teach later (for instance a still top body, a correct string grip or bow hand, a correct release…) Since we are all different customization should also be part of our teaching delivery. 4.2.3. Introduction / Pre-practice tasks In this section we consider the tasks and activities of the coach who will be conducting a level 1 archery session. We describe the tasks of the coach, which will be helpful to prepare such a session. To be a successful coach, you will have to simultaneously prepare the course as a whole and the unique content of each individual session while keeping the goals you want to achieve in mind. Preparation of a session includes, among other things, writing (briefly) the intended content of the session and preparing the equipment and teaching aids you plan to use in that session. There are several things to do before each practice session. The following is a suggested list of things to do: • Secure the shooting range by posting signs, locking doors and inspecting permanent signs as necessary • Prepare target faces"}

In chapter 3, “Coach’s role and what is coaching”, we went into more detail about to the role of the coach. 4.2.4. Typical tasks for the first session Actions such as choosing the shooting side and determination of arrow length are typical for the first session only. 4.2.4.1. Shooting side choice \n Before giving out equipment determine whether the novice is right- or left-handed. There are two possible criteria to consider when choosing the shooting side, and there have been long-standing differences of opinion as to which criterion is more appropriate: the hand or the eye? Good results have been achieved using either criterion. The shooting side or drawing hand could be chosen on the basis of the most agile hand. Since this hand is generally the strongest, the novice would be able to control the bow weight better, facilitating the learning of the shooting process. Manual ease and dexterity should not be neglected when choosing the shooting side. You probably remember how awkward you felt the first time you handled a bow; particularly when loading the arrow on the bow. This awkwardness increases when a right-hander is asked to shoot left-handed, or the other way round. But because of the fact that the act of shooting is new for the novice it is hardly an overriding influence in the process of learning this new skill at all. Consequently, some novices slow down the entire group, giving them an uncomfortable feeling of being clumsy. It is a task for the \ncoach to be inventive with such minor problems. If the novice is physically weak on one side, especially in the arm or shoulder, give priority to the side with greater dexterity, because performing some actions, such as nocking the arrow, are easier and generally the balance will be more solid. If you choose the dominant hand for determining the archer's shooting side, be sure the novice uses the proper eye. Right eye for those who draw the string with the right hand, and the opposite for the left eye. By using the \"shaft or straight line\" aiming method (see Chapter 6) this control is easy to ensure. Otherwise you may have to block the vision for the eye that is not used for aiming. If you decide to choose the shooting side based on eye dominance, you may use one of the following methods, or another you know of, to determine the master eye. Method #1: \n Have the novice overlap their hands and hold them out in front of their face as illustrated below. \n Have the novice look, with both of their eyes open, through a small hole in their crossed hands directly at the tutor, as shown in “figure 1”. Then get them to gradually bring their hands back to their face, keeping both of their eyes open and you will see the hands will come back to the eye that is their “master eye”, as shown in “figure 2”. There are many methods of determining the master eye but this is a simple and quick method."}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0065", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 64, "page_start": 65, "page_end": 65, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  65 \n  \n Figure 1 Figure 2 Method #2: \n It is a similar method as #1 above, but it can be done by the novice alone; without the assistance of the coach. The novices hold their arms out at arms’ length and look through a small hole in their crossed hands at an object in the distance. Keeping the hands steady, close the left eye. If the object is still visible through the hole, then the right eye is the dominant eye. To confirm this, with both eyes open the novice slowly brings hands back towards the face; the hole will be in front of the dominant eye. This method also works having the novice look through the hole in the middle of a CD or DVD instead of using the novice’s crossed hands. If a disc is not available, a piece of cardboard approximately 15cm square with a 1.5-2cm hole in the middle can be substituted. \n \nMethod #3: \nUsing a set-up similar to method #1, have the novice look at you through the hole. An alternative is to have the novice at about 2-4 m from the coach. Ask the novice to point, with the extended arm, with the index finger (or with the thumb) to your own dominant eye without moving his head and keeping both eyes open. The coach can now see under which eye the novice has his index finger placed. That eye is the dominant eye. You may check that with his other arm. Take care the novice doesn’t move his head while he repeats the procedure. Method #4: \nExtend one arm and with both eyes open, point a finger, or thumb, at an object (left illustration). \n Close the left eye. If your finger stays in line with the object, the right eye is dominant (Central illustration). Reverse the procedure and close the right eye to prove the left eye is not dominant (right illustration). For a left-eye the obvious adjustments to the above result are true. To summarize, when the right eye is used for aiming, the string is drawn with the right hand, the bow held in the left hand. The reverse is true when the left eye is used for aiming. Those who do not have a \"dominant\" eye for shooting may close one eye while aiming. Some novices cannot close the \"non-dominant\" eye, but though it is open during shooting, aiming can be done in the correct manner because of the extra strength and visual control the dominant eye has over the other eye. Alternately, the archer in this case could go with his/her dominant eye rather than hand. If this is not possible and the novice cannot close an eye, an eye patch may be used. If a novice has a very weak eye, the shooting side can be the side of the more able eye."}

Determining draw and arrow length \n Use an elastic string over the string bracing the bow, and a very long arrow that can be graduated. The use of the elastic string, or a very light bow, is recommended to avoid any top body deformation under the weight of a regular bow. The novice pulls the elastic string to full draw, in front of a target, keeping the bow shoulder down and the head straight. \n While the novice holds the draw, the coach or an assistant marks the arrow shaft at the back of the bow handle (ideally 1 inch in front of the shaft contact with the arrow-rest). The archer's draw length is the distance from the mark put on the arrow shaft to the bottom of the nock groove. Draw length depends on the body size and the form of the archer. Usually the measured draw length increases with the experience of the archer, so keep that in mind when determining the arrow length. Determining arrow length To determine the arrow length for a novice archer, simply add at least 2.5 cm (1\") to the draw length (illustration below). Bow length and weight can then be selected. \n 4.2.4.3. Choice of equipment \n Please refer to chapter 9 for further advice on equipment. For a level 1 course most bows will be fine as long as the bow is in good condition and is low poundage. The bows to be used in level 1 sessions must not be stronger than 22 Lbs. Having determined the draw length in inches, you simply add 40 to get the desired bow length. For instance a novice with a draw length of 28” needs a (28+40=) 68” bow. Unfortunately there is not always a big choice of bows available for the level 1 classes, so you should be aware of not taking too many novices into one class. You could give several sessions one after the other. Some equipment can also be made, including bows from PVC tubes. For further details about equipment, see Chapter 9 - Equipment and Facilities. 4.3. Archery class 4.3.1. First practice session The first practice session is in many cases a novice’s first impression of participating in archery. Thus it is important to ensure that the experience is positive, engaging and fun while providing the necessary instruction for success. Here are some items to include to help your first session to be a smooth one: 1. Introduce the coaches and archers. To keep overall supervision during the first couple of sessions a 1:6 coach:archer ratio is ideal. Check that all the forms are completed. If not done yet, do it now."}

Introduce the facilities and the equipment to be used. Also remind the novices about the recommendations regarding clothing. 3. Introduce warming-up. 4. Demonstrate how to shoot, having positioned the novices so they may properly and safely observe. Provide safety rules throughout the demonstration. Tell the novices the meaning of \"Let Down!” Explain the differences in shooting for left-handed individuals. If you have distributed the equipment beforehand (not recommended, see step 7), ask the novices to put their bows down, then perform the demonstration, first from one shooting side, then with the opposite side in case there are both right- and left-handed novices in your class. 5. For each novice determine the shooting side. 6. If necessary, divide the novices into workable pairings/groups bearing in mind space, equipment and coaches available. 7. Through mimicking and simulations, in front of a mirror if one is available, either hands free or using an elastic resistance band, have the beginners implement a proper shooting sequence. That is, ensure that each novice is using technically good shooting form and technique before they shoot any arrows. This is imperative as it is usually much more difficult to rectify form errors once the archer has progressed to using a set of archery equipment. Only after the novices’ form is adequate may they progress to the next step. 8. For each participant: • Measure the arrow length required • Issue a quiver and show the novice how to affix/adjust it. • Issue six arrows of the length to suit the bow weight and draw length of the archer, preferably fletched (or crested) in the same pattern. Remind the class that the arrow must be loaded on the string only when on the shooting line. • Estimate the bow weight and length • Distribute a strung bow that fits their physical requirements. Immediately emphasize and explain why dry firing is forbidden. Bows should have an identification number so that the novice can readily identify the bow for the next session. At this stage a bow is rarely too \nlight, on the contrary it is often too heavy, therefore encourage the use of lightweight bows • Distribute an armguard and show the novice how to affix/adjust it. • Determine if a chest guard is required and show the novice how to affix/adjust it. • Check if clothing is suitable, if not fix the clothing and provide recommendations for the next session. Note: two items are not mandatory for the first session: • A finger tab since few arrows will be shot during this first session and since the bows are very light. If/when you issue one, explain: - Why a tab is required. Shooting without a tab will soon result in sore fingers which will cause release mistakes. - How to grip the string with this item • A bow sling because during the first session the focus of the novices should be kept on the setting of the body. Any extra item to handle can divert their attention from the setting of the body. Furthermore during the first session the novices are generally so tense while pulling the string back that they are not able to have a relaxed bow hand. 9. Choose a shooting distance between 4 and 10 m (*), depending on the physical size of the archers. (*) Be aware, when using a very close target, that arrows that do not stick into the target may rebound back toward the archer. 10. Assign two to four novices per target. 11. Initially do not use a target face on the target butt; if you want to use one, an 80-cm target face will do. 12. The novices must each take their turn in shooting under supervision. 13. Watch the overall posture. • Pay attention to: o Draw/arrow length o String clearance in relation to the positions of the bow hand, elbow and bow shoulder • Assist the novices with shooting their first arrow. • Change equipment if necessary • Ask the beginners to advise you immediately if they feel any pain from"}

The physical actions of the shooting sequence are not always easy to learn and you as the coach may have to: • Emphasize the necessity to maintain the body in an upright position, keeping the shoulders low and draw the bow in the way you have explained otherwise safety is at risk. • Physically assist beginners to achieve the desired positions and actions. Alternating shooting with mimetics (the act of mimicking the body position and shot without using the bow) or using a rubber band is recommended at the start. 15. When the first end is over, explain: • How to leave the shooting line • Where to put the bow • Where to wait for the signal to retrieve arrows 16. To retrieve arrows: • Blow a whistle as a signal. • Take the class to a target, cautioning them to watch for arrows in the ground or on the floor. • Demonstrate the correct method of pulling arrows, and where to stand while retrieving them. • Caution that, at the target, nobody should stand in front of the arrows at any time. Arrows sometimes require some force to remove them from the target and consequently they may come out of the target with a backwards jerk. Someone standing in line with such an arrow, could be seriously injured. • When you are using a scoring board (not recommended for the first lesson, a game should have preference), and leaving it at the target, you need to put it behind the target stand or at least 2 meters in front of the target. Novices may hurt themselves, for instance getting poked in the eye, when bending over to pick it up off the ground or floor. 17. After the first end when the novices are back on the shooting line, review one technical point briefly using a short demonstration. The technical point you choose could be an aspect you wish to \nhighlight / reinforce, or be a fault you have observed in the class. 18. During the next end, assist those who have special difficulties (if any exist), and provide individual assistance to no more than two novices at a time. 19. Depending on the time available a game could be organised, if so we suggest \"Elimination by colour zones\" in chapter #12. This game does not necessitate point counting and helps beginners memorise the different colour zones. Elimination games allow a rest for those who are dropped out as well as a chance to observe the \"best\". \n 20. After each end of the game, when the novices are back on the shooting line, recall the next step of the game. With each eliminated archer, make participation possible by letting them observe, or score, or take down and store the equipment. 21. At the conclusion evaluate the session briefly with the participants. Discuss the \"feel\" of the session and invite suggestions from the participants. Ask if there are parts of the session that can be improved. You as a coach are also learning continuously, if you want to refine your coaching skills. 22. The session length is between 45 minutes to two hours, depending on the average maturity of the group."}

Second practice session After the warming-up, review the finer points of form especially the upper body: head straight, flat chest and back, shoulders low, relaxed arms and hands. The novices should start to observe their own form; a mirror is a good tool to for this purpose. Intensive controlled practice is needed to reinforce the correct form details. For the shooting part of this session the targets are set up at 10 m from the shooting line for teenagers and adults, or closer (around 6 m) for younger novices. From this second session on, the following class plan is suggested: \n 4.3.3. Following practice sessions In the sessions to come, the novices also learn the correct procedures of assembling, stringing and unstringing the bow. As mentioned in section 4.1.2 above, the shooting part of each session will concentrate on one skill from the list below: \n1. Stance and Body pre-setting 2. Hand positions 3. Bow raising 4. Pre-draw 5. Draw (Bow opening) 6. Full draw activity 7. String clearance 8. Bow hand (introduction of the sling) 9. Release 10. Follow-through 11. Facial reference position (face/draw-hand position) 12. String alignment 13. Sight setting (use of the quadrilateral method) 14. Final overview of the novice You have to accept that the novices will make many mistakes in their performance of the shooting sequence and that perfection is not the goal of a level 1 course. This means that you as a coach have to help the novice to focus on doing the steps in the shooting sequence properly instead of thinking of scoring or hitting the centre of the target. Once they start active shooting, novices may need to be given feedback about their mistakes if their scores are not in accordance with their expectations. Refocus these novices on their shooting skills. If they are result-orientated then looking for grouping is much more important than scoring. Remind the novices that they have to use the proper technique to get small groups. If they can shoot small groups they will be able to hit the centre. In conclusion of this chapter, one can say that following a structured plan of classes will help your programme to flourish and your novices to have the best success possible."}

People can learn through observation, examples and knowledge transfer, advice reinforced by mimicking, trial and error and repetition. Using a variety of different techniques will help your novices learn efficiently and correctly. Observation is an effective method of learning, and is the one used first. Demonstration allows the archer to observe. However, when demonstrating exactly what to do, use similar equipment to that which the archers will be using, i.e. elastic band, and respect the archery safety regulations. Observation implies both seeing and hearing. For it to be effective, the archers must be able to see what is being demonstrated and hear what is being said. 5.1. Prior knowledge Ask the archers what they know about the skill being emphasized during the practice session. Allow questions before a demonstration. Do not be surprised at the knowledge the beginners have. Beginner archers have perceptions of the sport or even prior experience. Giving the archer the opportunity to express their perceptions has advantages: • if incorrect, the opportunity to correct them, to better express your ideas, and teach with greater efficiency; • if incomplete, fill in the missing blanks; • encouraging their participation giving them motivation and avoiding the monotony of a single speaker; • you may hear certain comments that present the exercise more efficiently; • if they are correct, the advantages are the same as above and the work has already been done by others. No method is perfect. This one is no exception. Some archers may monopolize the conversation too often and/or talk too long. Limit comments to the subjects discussed. Use this educational tool because the dynamics of analysis and exchange outweigh the difficulties. \n5.2. Teaching aids Below are introduced tools and situations to be used for demonstrations and practice. Chapter 6 covers the uses of these teaching aids and tips in greater detail. 5.2.1 For demonstration The attention of beginner archers is often distracted by the release of the demonstrator’s arrow. Furthermore, some archers judge credibility based on where the arrow hits the target. When first demonstrating a skill, it is often better to use a dry-shot mechanism to keep the novice focused on the form element being taught. Examples include: • an elastic band \n • an elastic string"}

For practice The dry-shot devices and shooting without a target face also assist the novice to properly implement the technique being taught. Since teaching aids help archers better understand and feel future performance, it is important that they be similar as possible to the equipment used during regular practice. Moreover, these aids cannot differ too greatly from the actual shooting context so that too much time is not wasted on progressively reconstructing it. Consistent with this idea, let’s take the exercise of “push effort” as an example. To understand the string leg’s participation we could create the following situations by using three different teaching aids. Even if they are similar they can be perceived differently by the archer: • An assistant pushes directly on the archer’s bow hand, forcing the archer to counter with their string leg. This demonstrates how the string leg is involved in the shot. \n Human assistance only “I have to resist when I am being pushed”. \n• An assistant pushes on the archer’s bow forcing the archer to resist with their string leg. This demonstrates that the string leg would act in a similar fashion if the bow was being drawn by the archer."}

Notice how the different teaching aids that are above can help perceive situations differently. \nSome other aids will certainly be useful to your teaching: \n Shooting simulation with an elastic band allows an easier task implementation than with a bow for the novice and a good observation from the coach. \n The use of a thin elastic allows a decent string grip Standing on an elastic band allows the archer to practice their string hook \n A short string loop can be added to the elastic band for a better string grip. \n \nUsing a bent plastic tube for electric cables, helps the bow hand find the correct position more easily."}

Effective archer viewing arrangement For safety reasons, prohibit archers from walking in front of the shooting line when someone is in the process of shooting. However, we relax this rule during demonstrations because the “3/4 front” view (or 2 o’clock - see illustration below) is the best observation angle. Furthermore the arrow resting on the side of the bow opposite to the observers; hence there is no risk. \n The observers are standing on the opposite side of the bow from the arrow. When demonstrations are done at short distances from the target, 3m to 10m, we allow the archers to be in the 3/4 front view and give the instructor the opportunity to shoot while watching if students are paying attention to the essential point of the exercise.

The learning of new skills involves teaching proper basic form, not correcting minor initial faults. Correction of faults is done after the basics have been learned. The primary tasks at the entry level are: • Simplify the novice's initiation to archery; • Make the novice understand what to do; • Highlight what needs to be focused on; • Give feedback on the current execution quality. The feedback gives the novice the necessary information regarding what should be done and how it differs from what is being done. This ability to compare current form versus the ideal leads to learning to execute the skills properly. Putting this into practice as a coach requires being aware of the archery skills and their key elements as presented in this chapter. Also the coach needs to know how to: • Demonstrate the skills; • Create learning situations; • Provide effective feedback and encourage communication. Coaching theory courses teach four phases of technical skill teaching. Applied to archery, they are: • Skills and their key elements; • Demonstration – its organisation and presentation; • Practice and planning; • Feedback and observation. These phases and their implementation will be described in detail in this chapter. \nSome terminology: For right-handers and left-handers the action of archery is reversed with respect to the side of the body that is involved. For example, the right side of a right-handed archer and the left side of a left-handed archer are called the string side. Thus terms such as “bow arm” or “string ear” shall be used to describe body sides unambiguously. \n For similar reasons, we refer to the following three planes: • Shooting or flight plane: the vertical plane in which the arrow flies; • Horizontal plane: the plane parallel to the ground, including the nock; • Vertical or sagittal plane: the plane perpendicular to the ground along the shooting line, relating to an imaginary plane that divides a human body into right and left halves."}

For example, the right side of a right-handed archer and the left side of a left-handed archer are called the string side. Thus terms such as “bow arm” or “string ear” shall be used to describe body sides unambiguously. \n For similar reasons, we refer to the following three planes: • Shooting or flight plane: the vertical plane in which the arrow flies; • Horizontal plane: the plane parallel to the ground, including the nock; • Vertical or sagittal plane: the plane perpendicular to the ground along the shooting line, relating to an imaginary plane that divides a human body into right and left halves."}

Structure of this chapter The steps of the shooting sequence, also called the “technical elements,” and their key points are explained in this chapter. It is important for the coach to make sure the novice executes these elements accurately. Individualizing key elements occurs when the novice has mastered the basics. The responsibility for this lies with a level II coach. Each technical skill and/or step of the shooting sequence is presented here with a two-step approach its instruction. • First, the relevant complementary knowledge for each technical skill and/or step of the shooting sequence is highlighted in the order in which they are normally performed. Although it is not a technical skill, and introduction to the breathing sequence has been included in this manual. The shooting process starts from the stance, and is completed with the follow-through. • Then exercises that may be used in order to teach that step of the shooting and/or breathing sequence are presented. Note: For several exercises the coach may need to manipulate the novice in ways as described below. It is important to always get permission before touching the archer. The use of the “Standard Teaching Process” (STP) is highly recommended in these exercises. After some explanation and a demonstration from the coach, the STP includes having the novice do the following: \n• Some mimics (hands only) and simulations with elastic band or elastic string on the bow • Shooting under self-observation, using mirrors, photos, video, etc.; • Discovering the feeling of the skill at hand through shooting with closed eyes; • Shooting without any aiming task, i.e. without a target face; • Assimilation of the skill by increasing the difficulty level, i.e. shooting at targets that are progressively more and more challenging. For instance shooting at successively smaller spots. Another example is the use of cut-out targets: starting with a target face largely cut-out (i.e. only with the white rings), then shooting at a target less cut-out (only the white & black rings) and so on until shooting at a full target face; • Evaluation of skill endurance: Shooting with a target, with double scoring or a game. • Ending the session with shots at a blank butt and/or with closed eyes is a good way to link the proper feeling to a well implemented skill. The STP is illustrated in the exercise “Motionless and Stable Head – Exercise 2” The formats of the exercises below vary, in order to keep training fresh and effective. These exercise come from various authors and/or from the same author but written at different times; since many coaches always strive to improve their services, they change their exercises’ formats once in a while. As not all novices respond to the same training methods, it is suggested that each exercise be selected to suit each individual novice and training session being conducted. The following list is not exhaustive, but it is a basis upon which a training program can be developed. \n World Archery is always looking for new and interesting exercises that enhance the teaching of archery to beginners. Submissions from novices and coaches are most welcome"}

Complementary Knowledge Type: Preliminary action. Goals: Consistent spatial relationship to the target and achieving optimal stability. Form: Feet parallel to the shooting line/axis, positioned at approximately shoulder width apart, with a little more weight on the front part of the feet. Rationale: Such a stance gives novices the opportunity to repeat actions easily and accurately. It provides sound support for pull and push efforts in the shooting plane, gives consistent direction to the body in the flight plane, and makes the coach’s observation easier. Additionally, it reduces potential back problems and provides the optimum body stability in the toes-heel direction, by using the full length of the feet. \n The stance creates the foundation for a good shot. It is such an important issue in an archer's form that it should be repeatedly practiced without bow and arrow so that they will be able to find the same position each and every time with ease and with minimal or no variation. \n 6.1.2. Exercises Stance and Body Stability – Exercise 1 Objective: Show to the novices that, with parallel feet, they use the full length of their feet for stabilizing the body on the heels-toes direction, which is the most critically unstable direction. Situation: Full draw or in a regular standing position, eyes closed and without a bow, feet at more or less shoulder width apart Instructions: -­‐ First situation: toes spread out/heels in. This is comfortable, but the body may tilt towards the front; -­‐ Second situation: toes close together/heels spread out. This is uncomfortable and the body may tilt backwards; -­‐ Third situation: feet virtually parallel. This is often the most stable of the three positions. Conclusion: Parallel feet position offers the greatest stability. Any other feet orientations use a shorter feet length than with parallel feet for stabilizing the body in the heels-toes direction (the most unstable one). \n Alternately the coach gently pushes the novice on the chest (heels direction) and then back (toes direction). Repeat this exercise with the novice using different stances. This is another way to confirm that parallel feet position offers the most stability from heels to toes."}

STRING HAND AND GRIP 6.3.1. Complementary Knowledge For the string hand two stages are to be considered during the shooting sequence: • preliminary positioning before raising the bow; • during the force production period and the release. The following will mainly cover the first stage. See chapters on “Pre-Draw”, “Draw” and “Draw Extension” for further information. Type: Preliminary action. Objectives: Consistent finger positioning on the string in order to produce the same distribution of effort on the string, hence on each bow limb, shot after shot. Form: The fingers – usually the forefinger, the middle finger and the ring finger - hook the string in the middle segment of the finger or in the knuckle furthest from the hand. The fingers that are not used – usually the thumb and the little finger - are relaxed. \n27\nThumb and Little finger relaxed and curled\nPlacing the Fingers on the string\nPreparatory Movements\nPascal Colmaire –Development & Education Director of FITA The palm and wrist of the hand are relaxed. The back of the hand is flat and aligned with the back of the forearm. \n \n The three fingers divide the workload, each taking its share of the string pressure. At full draw, the back of the hand remains as vertical as possible, not curled-up, with the wrist as straight as possible. The interior of the forearm remains relatively relaxed. In effect, the hand is in the same axis, or shooting plane, as the forearm and arrow. The location of the string fingers on the string depends on the aiming method used by the novice (and the shooting distance, if relevant). Using the Shaft Aiming/Straight Line method for adults and teenagers with a bare Recurve bow: \n Three fingers beneath the arrow. The space between the nock and the top of the forefinger is about two fingers, depending on facial bone structure and size of string fingers. \n String grip for first sessions: straight line or shaft aiming method."}

It also simplifies aiming and provides a natural easy alignment of the string forearm with the arrow. Using the Point Aiming/Triangle method, for kids with a bare bow: \n Triangle method. Three fingers beneath the arrow, with the top of the forefinger just below the nock.

Rationale: The more relaxed the novice is, the better they can learn, and the less likely they are to twist the string. The \"depth\" of this string grip allows the muscles of the string hand, arm and forearm to be relatively relaxed, leading to the string releasing cleanly from the fingers."}

The main pressure zone on the bow grip should be close to the area shown on the following illustration: \n Rationale: This grip position allows the bow hand to be completely relaxed while still providing a stable and consistent placement in the bow. The use of a sling is recommended during the early sessions. Generally speaking, the more relaxed the novice is, the better their overall perception of sensory input. In the case of the bow hand, it is important to be aware of and eliminate any pressure on the bow that could generate torque on the riser. Also, getting the beginner used to a sling and letting the bow simply \"jump\" into the sling early on, while it is one more point to concentrate on, is one action less to change or learn in the future. \n6.4.2. Exercises Bow Hand – Exercise 1 Objective: To discover a bow hand position that is easy to replicate; solid, but not tiring, relaxed, and allowing an efficient pursuit of the shooting process, including good string clearance. Situation: Shooting situation. Equipment: Bow. Instructions: Have the novice try different bow hand positions, and notice: • The obstructed string displacement when the palm of the bow hand past the life line presses against the bow grip; \n String clearance is poor when the palm on the little finger side presses against the bow grip. • Any discomfort and the tiring nature of the position when the string is pulled slightly with the bow grip pressing against the base of the thumb. \n An unstable and tiring grip occurs when pressing the thumb against the bow grip.

The front of the foot is responsible for balancing so it is very important to get the stance correct during the early stages of teaching beginner archery. The following illustrations show the contributions of each leg to the shot process: \n The string leg participates in the production of the push. \n The bow leg contributes to the pull.

This form is not recommended; On the right a man with a flat lower back: This is the recommended form. Form: Ensure that the novice has a flat lower back; the spine is stretched up with shoulders in the same plane as the hips. The shoulders are lowered and chest is flattened, a slight stretching in the trapezius is often felt at this point. Turn the head toward the target to its maximum rotation whilst maintaining the “stretching-up” action in the spine. Rationale: Stretching the head and spine up assures an erect vertical stance. The flattening of the chest and the lowering of the shoulders lowers the centre of gravity, making the body more stable and contributes to better string clearance. Furthermore, the shoulders and the head are close to their final position, thus minimizing movement during the draw phase. \n6.5.2. \n  Exercises Pre-Setting the Body – Exercise 1 1. Have the novices close their eyes as soon as they grip the string, while they are slightly bent forward. Have them continue the sequence with eyes closed until they are upright and have come to full draw and then get them to open their eye(s) and complete the shot. Have them do this several times until they identify an internal strategy for re-setting their body in the same position. While they have their eyes closed, have them concentrate on: a) When and how they pre-set their body (Big Pyramid = the geometrical form between the aiming eye and both feet). This could be before raising the bow in the direction of the target or during the pre-draw, but seldom during the draw. b) The following points and feelings. • Upright body: vertical spine with body weight equally distributed over both feet; • Low centre of gravity: heavy and powerful belly, low shoulders and shoulder blades, flat chest, and stretching feeling in the trapezius muscle; • Solid support of the upper body on the hips: especially in the lower back; • Erect spine with upright head: quite flat nape with a “vertical firmness” keeping the energy and body weight down; • Body orientation: entire body in the shooting plane (shoulders above the hips and feet); • Body weight distribution: See “Upright Body” and less weight on heels than on the front part of the feet; • Head orientation facing the target: chin and nose pointed towards the target.

A popular height is around the nose level. Drawing a bow down from an elevated position appears easier than from other positions, but special care is required to keep the hands synchronized during the draw step. \n Rationale: The simplicity of this movement is easiest to repeat and it is a safe process, even if an arrow is released accidentally. The elements already in place are minimally disturbed, and are finalized following the action. The forces exerted on the upper limbs facilitate the low positioning of the shoulders. The body's inclination toward the string foot counterbalances the weight of the bow and moves the archer's centre of gravity towards the target (the use of bows with light mass weight will reduce this inclination). \n6.6.2. \n  Exercises Raising the Arms, Hands and Bow – Exercise 1 1.

Form: There are a few changes to the form described at the end of raising the bow. The string is now pulled back further than the bow elbow (refer to the illustrations further down). The pre-draw can occur at different heights, depending on the height at which the novice raises the bow. The most popular ones are: • Higher than the level at which the arrow will be while at full draw, up to eye level. \n • Up to the level at which the arrow will be while at full draw. \n Rationale: During this step the efforts are transferred to the back of the novice and the pre-setting of the \"Draw Force Line\" is improved.

Let the novice assume the body’s pre-setting, raising of the bow, and the draw positions. Ensure that the string hand follows a smooth curved line in the vertical plane to the end of the draw, i.e. until reaching the facial reference points. Throughout this movement both hands should remain parallel to the floor. This action should be progressive and in a continuous flow, avoiding staccato-like jerky movements. 2.

At this step, the top triangle (aiming eye and shoulders) is pre-set, hence the draw can start using the back muscles of the shoulder girdle. 5. Shooting arrows, starting with the raising of the bow, let the novice observe the string hand while the bow is being drawn; be attentive of the path of the novice’s string hand.

FACIAL MARKS (or REFERENCES) and AIMING SYSTEMS 6.9.1. \n  Complementary Knowledge The term “Facial Marks” is used instead of “Anchor” as the latter implies that the draw motion stops, whilst shooting a bow is actually a continuous movement. Furthermore in the straight line aiming method, there is no specific anchor. Some other wordings are used, among them: \"Rear sight position\" and \"Reference points\". They all refer to the spatial positioning of the arrow's nock with respect to the aiming eye. \n Type: Preliminary action Objective: To let the novice repeat, with accuracy and simplicity, the orientation of the arrow in reference to the aiming eye. Forms: \nThere are three geometrical forms generated by the various facial marks: straight line, triangle, and quadrilateral. a) Straight line (The simplest form) This is recommended for “Come and Try” events and the first few sessions, particularly in a recreational environment or short entry-level program. This method involves aiming along the shaft of the arrow. At full draw, the shaft is on the aiming axis (line from the eye to the target), with the nock at about 2.5 cm in front of the aiming eye. To allow comfortable aiming, the space between the nock and the forefinger of the string hand is about two fingers’ width or roughly 4 to 5 cm. Rationale: This method makes learning the following actions simple: 1 Consistent positioning of the arrow at full draw without the need to develop sensitive facial reference marks. 2 Control of the position of the aiming eye with no string alignment required. 3 Aiming. This very simple way of aiming and visual alignment allows the novice to: • be consistent and precise with ease, thus obtaining encouraging results; • better understand the movement that begins with the draw and concludes after the release, reducing the temptation to stop between drawing and aiming. 4 Alignment of the string forearm with the arrow (line of forces). This form, also called \"Apache\" or Shaft aiming”, achieves satisfactory results for novices when the target is at the distance below: AGE Shooting Distances 7 & less 4 – 6 M 8 – 10 6 – 10 M 11 – 12 8 – 12 M 13 & + 10 – 15 M These shooting distances should be adapted to the physical size of the person; age as the only reference is not enough. Depending on body size and draw weight of the bow, this method can be used at distances up to 15 m or in rare cases up to 20 m."}

Even so it is not a mandatory starting method but it does provide good results quickly and easily. With the shaft aiming method, any difference in the draw or any slight creeping has a less of an effect than in the triangle method (see below). \n In the straight line aiming method the arrow is visually positioned while the aiming eye position is ensured. b) Triangle (The intermediate and least accurate form) This is probably the most ancient archery aiming technique after the instinctive shooting. The \"triangle\" is a simpler geometrical design than the \"quadrilateral”. However, a simpler geometrical design does not mean easier to repeat and learn. This form is the most difficult and least accurate aiming style to master in archery. The arrow is positioned using two reference points; • Arrow point, by visual placement on the target; • Arrow nock, through contact of the string hand on the face. To ensure a consistent repetition of the triangle the novice has to: • maintain a constant draw; • position the aiming eye using a string alignment technique. While shooting a given distance, the novice's string fingers are at a constant distance from the nock, usually just below it. At full draw, the string hand is always placed at the same spot on the novice's face, for example the tip of the forefinger touching the corner of the lips and the top of the hand laying just under the cheek bone. Rationale: This method highlights all the difficulties and pleasures of archery. The difficulty with this method is that aiming occurs using the arrow point which is: • Quite large, making an inaccurate aiming mark; • Not as stable or consistent as a fixed sight pin - especially for a beginning archer. It is also difficult to get a consistent string-finger mark on the jaw. \nHowever it is of interest, both academically and practically, since it is similar to the original archery form. It is important to teach it to novices because it may be the style of archery he/she likes best. This form is usually taught after the straight-line, but before the use of the quadrilateral. The novice discovers the ballistic effects of an arrow's trajectory and the importance of consistently reproducing the nock position and aligning the bow string. \n Facial marks for the use of the triangle method. Once these technical elements have been learned, the quadrilateral form can be considered. c) Quadrilateral (The most common and accurate form) \n The arrow is positioned by two reference points: • A sight (pin or ring) is visually positioned in the aiming line in accordance with the target centre rather than using the arrow point as a sighting aid as in the triangular method.. Hence, the proper use of a sight needs to be introduced before practicing this method; • The drawing fingers around the arrow nock through tactile placement of the string hand on the face. Furthermore, to ensure the consistent repetition of the quadrilateral, the novice must maintain: • The bow in the vertical plane, or consistently canted the same amount; • A consistent draw length; • A consistent aiming eye position to allow string alignment."}

By imagining how difficult it is for a novice to repeat all these tasks with consistency, a coach will understand why it is recommended to run a lot of mimics and simulations (sometimes with an elastic resistance), before allowing the first shots. The \"Mediterranean\" string grip type, sometimes called the \"cigarette\" string grip, is the most common one used with the quadrilateral method. The forefinger is just above the nock, while the middle and ring fingers are below. The forefinger usually touches the top of the nock without applying pressure. The middle finger of the novice is usually kept away from the nock in order to keep it from lifting the arrow shaft off the rest at full draw. Usually the string hand is below the lower jaw, with the string in contact with the chin, either to \nthe side of the chin or front-centre, and touching the tip of the nose. We have just covered the 3 main types of facial marks existing in target archery. Since the most accurate one (quadrilateral) is not the simplest one to learn or teach, we can think as follows. Question #1: What is a more simple form than a quadrilateral form (with 4 sides and 4 angles)? Answer #1: A triangle (with 3 sides and 3 angles). Question #2: What is a more simple form than a triangle (with 3 sides and 3 angles)? Answer #2: A simple straight line (no angles, just a line)."}

Teaching the forms from simplest to most sophisticated allows the novice to experiment with at least two types of archery - with and without a sight - allowing them to choose which type of archery they prefer. Tips for linking the 3 methods: Linking the various facial marks and aiming systems in an entry level program can be done as follows: • Teach the novice the straight line method at a short distance, as indicated above in “a) Straight line (The simplest form).” \n \nAGE Shooting Distances 7 & less 4 – 6 M 8 – 10 6 – 10 M 11 – 12 8 – 12 M 13 & + 10 – 15 M These shooting distances should be adapted to the physical size of the person; the age as the only reference is not enough. The straight line method reduces the number of unusual reference points, such as string against the chin, string-hand below the lower jaw, cheek bone, or against the jaw, and allows the novice to focus on learning the real fundamentals. • When the novice's score improves (for example, 115 points for 15 arrows shot at an 80 cm target face), increase the distance being shot by 5 m; less for the youngest, and so on until they are shooting 30 m. Along with the progression of the shooting distance, allow the novice to experiment with the 3 aiming systems."}

If the shooting distance requires the novice to aim above the face, switch to the triangle method. • In the case where a novice cannot reach 115 points at a distance with the triangle aiming system, or when the novice can score an average of 24 points out of 3 arrows at 20 or 25 metres, depending on the novice's skill, teach the quadrilateral method. • It is usually while learning the quadrilateral method that the novice chooses their preferred shooting method, which is usually either returning to the triangle method (without sight) or going on with the quadrilateral method and using a sight. For the facial marks used in instinctive/intuitive aiming, see chapter 8, “Starting With a Traditional Bow”. Complementary Knowledge: String alignment is a key element for aiming since all the components of the complete archer/bow unit must be aligned and kept aligned as the archer proceeds through the next steps in the shooting sequence Clarification on a possible confusion: String alignment is a title which is open to misinterpretation because many beginners think that the string should be moved to the “proper” spot. In reality, the string does not move; on a Recurve bow, it is always in the centre of the bow. The string appears to be at different locations when the aiming eye moves with respect to the string and the bow. Even if “string alignment” is a poor title, we will use it because it is the common name of this technical element in archery. Purpose of the “string alignment”: The novice adjusts the position of the aiming eye with reference to the string and the bow in the shooting plane to ensure the arrow is properly and consistently directed towards the target. \n A common string alignment, especially with no sight."}

Situation: Simulations. \n In this situation the two forearms are aligned. Equipment: Mirror. Instructions: The string fingers grasp the bow forefinger that is vertical and pointed toward the ground. Alternatively, as shown in the picture above and in the next exercise, the novice can grip a vertical arrow with his fingers. Draw using both hands bringing: • the tip of the string forefinger to touch the centre of the mouth between the lips, for straight line and triangle methods; • the enlaced fingers under the chin and in front of the neck for the quadrilateral method. The forearms form a horizontal line. The head is turned towards the target. Imagine an arrow in the place of the bow forearm; the string forearm and arrow are in perfect alignment. Leave the string hand where it is and disengage the bow hand. Note this location as the facial reference for when the novice shoots. Using a mirror for visual feedback helps the novice locate the facial reference mark during practice when a coach is not available. Repeat this exercise having the novice stand in front of a mirror and drawing a bow that is strung with an elastic string. Ensure that the archer draws to the facial marks determined in the first step. When they consistently draw to the same facial marks, continue with a normally strung bow. \nFacial Marks and String Forearm Alignment for Sight Users - Exercise The following set of exercises helps the novice identify the facial references that allow good alignment of the arrow and the string forearm. 1. Let the novice assume the shooting position whilst on the shooting line. Have an assistant on the line with the novice, holding a mirror at face level, one meter away from the archer. 2. Have the novice grip a stiff stick, thin arrow, or pencil with his fingers, using a grip as closely resembling the position normally used on the string as possible, in the first joint, or a little deeper. 3. Let them use the forefinger of their bow hand to represent the normal position of the arrow, for instance between the forefinger and middle finger for the quadrilateral aiming system, as shown in the illustration below. \n As in the previous exercise, let the novice bring the fingers that are gripping the stick to a good facial mark whilst watching along the shooting line (or in the mirror). The stick should be vertical and right in the middle of the novice’s face, touching his nose. At this stage: • Make sure the shoulders are kept low; • The arms, forearms, and wrists are relaxed; • The forearms are be on the same horizontal line at about mouth or chin level; • Observe that the forearms are aligned in all planes using the ideal force alignment as illustrated below."}

Let the novice reproduce this ideal form whilst simulating full draw with the bow. 4. Let the novice turn his head gently towards the target. \n Novices without a sight should now feel the tip of their forefinger somewhere near the corner of the mouth, as shown in the next illustration. \n \nFor those using a sight, they should feel the contact of their forefinger under their jaw, as well as the string contact with their chin as shown below. \n The assistant will move the stick to bring the top part to the middle of the nose, as in the picture below, so that the arrow/stick imitates the position of novice’s string at full draw. \n Ask the assistant to place a mark on the novice’s chin where the string should be. Due to the bow weight and the collapsing or stretching of some parts of the body while at full draw, the string location will be about half a centimetre (for entry level bow weight) to the target side of the stick. A good way to mark this location is to affix a piece of tape on the novice’s chin with the rear edge at about 5-6 mm ahead of the stick, as illustrated below."}

Then look in the mirror. If the string is at the proper facial mark, shoot the arrow. If not, then let down and start again. • Come to full draw while looking at a blank butt. Check in the mirror to see if the string is located correctly. If it is, shoot the arrow. If not, then let down and start again. • Rotate through each of the above exercises in sequence. Whilst at full draw in each case take a quick look in the mirror to ensure the string is correctly located. If it is, shoot the arrow. If it is not, let down and start again. • Same exercise but introduce a fourth step: drawing the bow towards a regular target face. At full draw look quickly in the mirror to ensure that the string is correctly located and, if so, shoot the arrow. If not, let down and start again. • Finish by shooting at a regular target face and alternating the arrows as follows: -­‐ One arrow - checking in the mirror that the string is correctly located and, if it is, shoot the arrow. If it is not, let down and start again; and: -­‐ One arrow - shoot the arrow without looking in the mirror. However, if the location of the string feels wrong, let down and start again. The coach should be watching the facial marks in order to reinforce the archer’s sense of feel. \nFacial References Versus the Arrow / String Forearm Alignment - Exercise This exercise builds on the previous one by adding a check for proper alignment of the string forearm in the shooting plane. This additional check starts at step #6. Equipment: As for the previous exercise, plus a thin cord, 1.5 m in length, with a loop at one end (similar in size to a bow string loop) or a spare bow string. Step #1 to 5: See previous exercise 6. Same as for the previous exercise but with; • An assistant standing behind the novice; • The loop of the cord over the bow’s upper limb tip. The assistant aligns the rope with the elastic string in the middle of the bow. Keeping this alignment, the assistant moves the cord until it touches the novice’s string elbow. \n If necessary, move the location of the tape on the novice’s face until the cord is as close as possible to the tip of the elbow.

Note: If over the next steps, the novice feels some friction of the string on the face upon release (particularly on the chin), it is because the tape is too far back. If so, move the tape a forwards (towards the centre of the face) in small increments until the release is painless, then move the tape 2 additional mm forwards. 7. Optionally, an arrow can be loaded on the elastic string and the assistant can check the draw length, watching where the arrow point comes to. 8. Have the novice take the bow and come to full draw. It is important that the novice not lean his head toward the target or string at any time and maintain the preliminary positions of low shoulders and straight head throughout the process. Let the novice have the string and fingers touch the face according to the previously determined facial marks. The assistant continues to check the position of the cord on the archer’s string elbow. \n Have the novice use a mirror to check that the bow string goes just a little further back than the piece of tape, then close their eyes to concentrate on feeling the touch. \nWhen the novice can repeat the facial marks reliably, move to next step with or without the tape on the archer’s chin. \n End the exercise as the previous one by alternating shots: first checking in the mirror, then going by feel alone.

In proper alignment, this stick should angle slightly towards the archer’s bow rather than being parallel to the arrow on the bow. If the stick points away from or too far in towards the bow, have the novice adjust their alignment until the correct position is obtained. Repeat this process until the novice regularly achieves proper shoulder alignment by feel alone. \n \nHorizontal String Forearm Alignment - Exercise 1. The assistant attaches a rope to the pressure point on the bow grip. 2. The assistant then extends the rope in the direction of the archer’s string elbow, lining it up near the middle finger on the string, without changing the previous alignment. \n • If the novice grips the string with three fingers together, like most bare-bow archers, the rope should pass right in the centre of the middle finger. • If the nock is between the forefinger and the middle finger, like most archers who use a sight, have the rope pass at the level of the top quarter of the middle finger. • If the novice does not use the ring finger, or only uses it a little, move the rope up by ¼ of a finger width. 3. The rope should pass close to the elbow tip, proving that the archer’s forearm is on the line of force created by the novice (from bow to string). Very often the rope is just below the “ball” located at the tip of the string elbow. To correct a too high or low string elbow, first try having the novice remove some tension around the string shoulder blade area. It is usually the string shoulder height that influences the height of the string elbow. Note that moving the string elbow height could change the alignment of the archer’s string forearm with the arrow."}

Complementary Knowledge Other common names for this essential technical skill: “Full draw efforts”, “Draw increase”, “Extension/expansion” Type: Force generating movements. Objective: • Stability of body and equipment for effective aiming and holding the bow at full draw without creeping or collapsing due to the spring effect of the bow; • Extending the draw length – for novices using a clicker, or using back tension; • Produce an efficient release. The actual movement (*) in the draw expansion phase is quite small. The largest displacement is produced by clicker users and is in the neighborhood of 4 to 6 mm, or 2 to 3 mm per side. Therefore we are referring to micro movements; almost isometric muscle contractions. In the following exercises one often moves the string shoulder blade 10 times more than the required range, with a move up to 2 to 3 cm. While this seems like too much, it is done so the novice can learn the feeling of the proper motion. * Note: The terms “move” and “moving” will be used to describe the action of the shoulder blade (and consequently the progression of the elbow) during the draw expansion phase. Moving is not the most appropriate word, because when watching the back of a topless archer, it is very difficult to see any blade displacement. This action (expansion) should not generate any movement of the string on the chin, face or chest. Nevertheless “move” or “moving” are the terms generally used in archery for lack of better ones. Form: The complete bow/archer unit should maintain its alignment and orientation within itself as well as externally and with respect to the target. The torso is upright and immobile. The body is in an upright position with the chest flat and low. The spine and head are erect. The shoulders should be exerting a slight but constant pressure downwards while contributing to the increase of the draw length. A balance must be struck between the push and pull forces. These efforts are supported by the legs, causing a slight compression of the abdominal area. There is no need for a large range of motion, as explained above. \n Whatever the technique applied on the string side and/or the bow side, during this step/action, the constants are: • Consistent height and alignment of the shoulders; • Consistent position of the bow shoulder; \n No displacement of the bow shoulder upwards and/or inwards. • Consistent spacing between the arrow and the bow shoulder in the horizontal plane; • Consistent spacing between the arrow and the bow shoulder in the vertical plane; • Consistent spacing between the chin and the bow shoulder; • The body should remain upright and the head centred on the body, when viewed face-on (along the vertical plane);"}

Rationale: Due to the spring effect of the bow at full draw, the novice must withstand the tendency to let the upper body collapse as shown in the image below. \nA typical collapse due to the spring effect of the bow. \nInsufficient strength and/or poor alignment are likely causes for collapse under the spring effect of the bow. Using proper form, a bow with light enough draw weight, and the major muscles to generate the necessary power are the keys to resisting this collapse. Hence, whatever the draw extension technique selected for the archer, some sort of upper body expansion, as shown in the next picture, is required. \n Stretching the spine upward helps it stay erect and vertical. Flattening the chest and lowering the shoulders lowers the centre of gravity. This low centre of gravity makes the body more stable and contributes to better string clearance as well as helping the archer be more relaxed. The combination of the above actions contributes to maintaining the draw length and helps to keep the head and the aiming eye at a constant level. The production of effort should be symmetrical in nature to reduce local fatigue effects and minimize the risk of injury. During the draw expansion, the arrow orientation should be perfectly maintained with no deviation. Thus the aiming eye must be kept still and the proper alignment of it with respect to the string, the riser/sight and the target must be maintained."}

It is up to the coach to work with each novice individually to find out the most efficient technique for them. By efficient we refer to the following criteria: • No “level effect” – that is, no change in the pre-settled form, particularly the “big pyramid” (the top of the pyramid is the aiming eye – the base is made of the archer’s feet); • Smooth and regular progression of the arrow point; • Very light and smooth increase of the string pressure on the face; • Very little and slow sliding friction of the string hand against the chin when using a low facial reference; • Relaxed string arm, forearm, wrist and hand (these elements do not generate the draw increase; it comes from the back and posterior part of the string shoulder); • When a clicker is used, 2 - 3 seconds to get through the clicker. In conclusion, the effect of the draw expansion step is to extend the draw length a little; hence to slightly deform the body. But this small extension should not disturb the orientation of the bow/archer unit in reference to the target. For each archer, the coach has to find the proper combination of draw extension techniques to allow an in-line extension. The following sections describe where the movement of the draw expansion can be generated. Bow Scapula action: The bow scapula should progress toward the target while the archer’s body stays vertical, as shown below. \n Note: The concept of squeezing the two blades is not relevant, since the novice reduces the draw while squeezing the bow blade towards the spine. When teaching how to extend the bow shoulder, the coach must pay attention to maintaining proper orientation of the bow/archer unit including: height and line of the shoulders, upright body, head, and verticality of the bow. Additionally, the following errors are commonly encountered while learning this specific technique: • The bow elbow should remain in the same orientation: When pushing, many beginners rotate their elbow down; such a modification should be avoided. \n • The bow hand should also remain in the same position on the bow grip, particularly in height, i.e. keeping the same angle as shown in red in the illustration below. \n The Various String Scapula Actions: \n \n+ \n+"}

For the two first alternatives there are three variations in height: horizontally, a little upward or a little downward. All of them can be observed at the string elbow level, but are generated from the string scapula. If the archer’s back is not fully covered, the scapula motion can be observed. We recommend teaching a horizontal extension to the beginners first. Due to the potential issues for each method, using a technique that has a change in height should only be used in specific cases where it is necessary. Let us detail these various techniques on the string side. 1. The string scapula moves toward the spine 1.1. The string elbow moves horizontally towards the back, parallel to the vertical plane; it does not move away from the target at all. This movement is generated by squeezing the string shoulder blade towards the spine, pulling the string elbow a little toward the spine as well. \n This technique is popularly known as “Back Tension”. Advantage: • It provides a nice release: lively, dynamic, in-line, and originating from the string shoulder. Potential issues: • Requires a strong core to avoid rotating the upper body (horizontal level effect) and keep the release hand from pulling away from the neck; \n • Misalignment of aiming eye, string, bow/sight, and target may occur due to the possible body rotation mentioned above. 1.2. The string elbow moves diagonally down towards the archer’s coccyx. This movement is generated by the string scapula moving down and towards the spine. \n In this technique big, and therefore powerful, muscles are used. It requires a strong core to avoid canting the entire body (vertical level effect, body leaning away from the target) and dropping the bow arm. Advantages: • Good ring finger grip on the string; • Improved forefinger/chin contact. Potential issues: • Decreased contact between the rear part of the string hand and the jaw; • Entire body could lean away from target. \n5"}

With the string elbow moving diagonally upwards. \n \n This technique displaces the string scapula toward the spine with the use of the intermediate and posterior bundles of the string deltoid muscle; hence it is a technique using some muscular activity above a line passing through the top of the shoulder joints. \n Advantage: • Improved contact between the string hand and the jaw. Potential issues: • Ring finger may slip on the string; • Contact between the forefinger and chin may be lost; \n• Head may lean down and forward. 2. The string scapula moves away from the spine 2.1. The string elbow moves horizontally backward (away from the target) along the draw force line. \n This movement is generated by spreading the blade away from the spine. This is the natural motion done when pulling on our hands as show in the illustration below. \n Advantages: • Favours the body alignment during the extension (no body twist and/or canting); \n Scapula moving horizontally away from the spine enables almost perfect maintenance of the alignment of the forces in the shooting plane throughout the expansion process. • Facilitates alignment during the release as well, since the movement is along the arrow axis; • Combined with the push (bow shoulder blade moving away) both sides of the novice work symmetrically. \n Potential issue: • Implementation is sometimes found difficult or awkward."}

The lower point moves up and away from the spine creating the upward motion of the elbow. \n The advantages and potential issues for this method are the same as those in #1.3 above. \n3. The string scapula does not move This method is not generally taught, although it is often naturally used by many archers. The string scapula remains stationary or, in some cases, it flattens slightly. The string elbow must move horizontally for this style. Any upward or downward displacement is not compatible with a static string shoulder blade, since those motions would make the string shoulder blade move. The direction of the displacement of the string elbow comes from a combination of the elbow movements of two previous methods, i.e. away from the spine/target and toward the back. \n Advantage: • The action contributes to keeping a good body orientation. Potential issue: • Fatigue of the posterior bundle of the deltoid. ---------- For any Draw Expansion Technique: When teaching any technique on how to extend with the string shoulder, the coach must pay attention to the orientation of the bow/archer unit, including the height and line of the shoulders, upright body, head, and verticality of the bow. In addition, special attention must be paid to the following issues that are commonly encountered while learning this specific skill: Consistent string hand with: Relaxed unused fingers: • Tension in the unused fingers often increases during the learning phase. This should be avoided to enable better use of the muscles in the back and posterior part of the string shoulder."}

Lowering of the Shoulders - Exercise Objective: Discover some of the effort needed to counteract the compression caused by the tension of the bow and generate form with efficient muscle usage. Equipment: Two supports, placed 70 cm apart and 70 to 120 cm high (e.g. two chairs with a person sitting on each chair to keep the chairs from moving or tipping over.) Instructions: Support the body with the hands, have the feet off the ground, shrug the shoulders, and lower the body. The width of the shoulders will now be at a minimum. \n Collapsed chest shrinks the triangle between the shoulders and aiming eyes, the shoulder span is reduced. \nNo"}

The width of the shoulders will increase to the maximum position. \n Chest expansion clears the head from the shoulders and increases the shoulder span. This position can be compared to a novice at full draw trying to increase the draw length, as shown below. \n While shooting, and if produced gently, continuously and slowly, this increase will be enough to counteract the compression of the shoulders by the action of the bow, and will generate good muscle tone in the form.\n\nCOACHING MANUAL \n  152 \n  \nVertical Extension - Exercise 1. The novice lengthens the body vertically and performs the \"pigeon neck\" movements, in front of the mirror. For this the novice needs to flatten the neck while stretching it up.

This latter feeling is called Vertical Extension. \n Nape stretching: “The pigeon neck”. 2. In front of a mirror, with an elastic stretch band held in the bow hand and attached to the string elbow, the novice comes to “full draw”, and then tries to stretch the elastic even further through the action described in the previous step without moving the arms, rather through an increase of the vertical extension. \n \nCare must be taken when doing this exercise in case the novice has a history of health problems in the neck or spine.

Situation: Various. Equipment: Elastic band, mirror, elastic string, archery equipment and optionally a laser to be affixed on the head. Instructions: Reminder: we refer to a micro movement of 2 to 3 mm. In the following exercises one often moves the string shoulder blade 10 times more than the required range, up to 2 to 3 cm. While this may seem like too much, it is done so the novice can learn the feeling of the proper motion. 1. Simulation Have the novice simulate the movement below: \n Starting position Action The novice places the knuckles of their string hand on the sternum, and then moves their elbow around and back. The fingers uncurl and stay in contact with the chest. When moving to the position on the right, the string shoulder blade of this left-handed novice moves toward the spine. Another simulation that helps to feel the shoulder movement is shown below. First, have the novice hold an arrow against the front side of their body and near the string shoulder."}

AIMING 6.11.1 Complementary Knowledge A matter of balance between two modes of attention A novice thinks that aiming accurately is the main task to do in order to get the arrow into the centre of the target. As an experienced archer, the apprentice-coach already knows that this is not correct, since the feeling of a proper shooting sequence, form, mental predispositions, etc. are fundamental performance factors. Hence the main difficulty that archery coaches face is the over-aiming attempted by novice archers, many intermediate, and even some advanced ones. Most archery coaches organise training sessions without using a target face to force the novice to be focused on the control of his/her body and state of mind, i.e. to be internally focused. Aiming requires some external focus in order to align some visual references. In other words, an efficient shot requires proper balance between the internal and external focus. Source of stability A novice often states that his/her bow arm is not stable because they see their sight or arrow point moving. While it is possibly a bow arm issue, that is usually not the actual reason. First of all, a sight cannot be totally motionless. A “stable” sight is generated by good specific strength, body balance, technical control and so on. When seeing the sight moving, the novice often re-centres the sight by consciously modifying the channel of forces in the upper body/top pyramid (mainly the bow shoulder and arm), which generates a change in the launch-pad and results in a different shot. \n Without clicker: While aiming, the shape of the top pyramid must be maintained. With Clicker: the top pyramid should be slightly stretched out in its longitudinal axis. \nThe importance of keeping the shoulders and hips directly above the feet It is common to sway a little forward or backward but the important thing is to keep the entire body within the shooting plane and avoid any left or right twist. The image below depicts an archer shooting at a 122 cm face at approximately 30 metres, as seen from 5 metres behind. \n Clearly, the archer is aiming straight at the centre of the target. The following picture shows the same archer being moved a few centimetres forward (in the direction of his toes) due to a body swing or a wind from left to right. \n Let us suppose that the feet are still in the same position and the archer has kept his form with the shoulders directly above the hips and feet, but the sight is now aiming at the red/blue on the right."}

The next diagram shows the three previous pictures collated into one picture looking from behind, also looking down from above. \n This shows that the sight could be moving across the target face from red-to-red, or even blue-to-blue in extreme conditions. In the last image, we superimpose a 122 cm face up close to the archer. It is clear that, even though the archer has moved left or right these few centimetres, as long as the archer has held the form, when they release the arrow it will still hit the gold. \n Due to the shooting distance, the target appears smaller than it really is. So a small left or right movement of the body will look as if it is a massive movement with reference to the target, and the sight will move from the gold out to the red or even to the blue depending on what distance the target is set at. This is only an optical illusion and is a serious trap for the novice. When he/she sees the sight away from the gold, the novice usually brings it back into the centre of the target by moving the bow arm instead of bringing back the entire body into the shooting plane and keeping the shoulders directly above the hips and feet. By moving the bow arm, the novice creates a shooting angle and breaks the alignment of the forces, as illustrated below. Hence one of the most important things for an archer to do during adverse weather conditions is to keep their form with the shoulders directly above the hips and feet. A strong core is therefore of paramount importance. When it is windy, therefore, it is best to consider the conditions, pick an aiming spot, come to full draw, and shoot from solid and strong foundation."}

Help the novice to set the sight in order to get shots centred on the target. 2. Afterwards adjust the sight in one direction then ask the novice to observe where the shots group. Re-centre the sight and then move it in another direction and have the student notice where the arrows group. Since the shots group in the opposite direction of the sight displacement - for instance when the sight is moved to the right, the impacts deviate to the left – help the novice develop a simple rule. Start with the conclusion “When the sight pin is moved right, the arrows went to the left” In other words, if the arrows are grouping to the right, the sight pin should be moved to the right. Hence the simple formula is to move the sight in the same direction of where the arrow impacts on the target. \n Checkerboard target face. \nAiming Adjustment in Bare-bow Shooting (the Triangle Method) - Exercise Objectives: Teach the novices who do not use a bow sight how they can aim, i.e. which elements they should change to hit the centre of the target, particularly when shooting from different distances. Here are some exercises for the two most popular aiming techniques without a sight: String walking and Face walking. For more details on bare-bow, please refer to the specific chapter on bare-bow in the WA level 2 coaching manual. STRING WALKING: It is recommended that novices in the bare-bow discipline start with string walking, which is the most accepted style. String walking refers to the process of varying the novice’s fingers position vertically on the string when changing the shooting distance and using a consistent anchor point (reference point). A popular facial reference point is having the tip of the forefinger touching the corner of the mouth while having the rest of the finger located firmly underneath the cheekbone, as shown in the pictures below. The closer to the target, the lower the novice’s fingers are located on the string and the closer arrow nock is to the eye. The further away from the target, the closer the fingers are to the nocking point on the string, and the arrow nock is lower with respect to the eye. Equipment: A mirror and a braced bow fitted with an elastic string. Instructions: 1. With the string fingers far down from the nock (10cm), come to the full draw position and aim at a target with the point. Look at the eye-arrow distance and the slope of the arrow in the mirror - it is probably almost parallel to the ground."}

The arrow should now show an upward slope. Imagine the arrow trajectory in relation to the previous position. \n For a long shooting distance\n \nConclusion: The string fingers at a distance from the arrow nock orients the arrow parallel to the ground or sloping slightly down. The string fingers close to the arrow nock orients the arrow upward. 2. Follow up using these various exercises while shooting at approximately three meters. Have the novice notice the inverse correlation between the location of the fingers on the string and the height of impact. Then organize a game requiring good horizontal precision from various distances, or even from the same shooting distance, and therefore requiring proper positioning of the fingers on the string. One example of such a game is shooting at a folded target or a line drawn on a target face. FACE WALKING: Anchor points/facial marks are usually described as being high or low on the face. An anchor point/facial mark low down the face is identified as low. \n A low facial mark orients the arrow upward. An anchor point/facial mark on or underneath the cheekbone is called high. \n A high facial mark orients the arrow downward."}

Situation: Various simulations. Equipment: A mirror and an arrow. Instructions: In front of a mirror, hold an arrow by the nock, between the string fingers. Place the front part of the arrow in the depression between the thumb and forefinger on the bow hand. Simulate a full draw position with a high facial mark and aim at a particular spot with the point. Look at the eye-arrow distance and the slope of the arrow in the mirror. Do the same thing but with the string hand positioned at a lower location on the face. Imagine the arrow trajectory in relation to the first position and to a situation where the position would be very close to the eye. Conclusion: • A high facial mark orients the arrow downward; • A low facial mark orients the arrow upward. Variation: This exercise can be accomplished with an arrow drawn on a: • bow fitted with an elastic string; • regular bow. \n A high facial reference orients the arrow point downward, and low facial reference orients the arrow point upward. Follow up using these various exercises while shooting at approximately three meters.

The wrist should also maintain a consistent shape before, during and after the release. Since the release is a continuation of the shoulder motion and the forearm/arm unit is primarily a simple relay between the string shoulder and the string, the angle between the string forearm and upper arm changes very little, if at all. \n The form of the release can be influenced by: • the posture of the novice at full draw, particularly the overall body alignment; • the dynamism of the draw extension, particularly on the novice’s string side; • the draw extension technique adopted by the novice; • the bow weight. Hence there are various release shapes, depending on skeletal differences and type of muscular action at full draw. \nIt is easy to visualise the effect that variations in the draw extension on the string side would have on the release: • little or no expansion at full draw generates quite a static release, i.e. the string hand does not move backwards very much; • a strong expansion at full draw generates a lively release, i.e. that the string hand moves backward quite fast. The various draw extension techniques discussed in the previous sections will affect the release action as follows: Remember that the terms “move” and “moving” when used to describe shoulder blade action may not refer to a visible motion. Rather they describe the feeling and intent as experienced by the archer. \n The release form generated by the string elbow moving horizontally whilst squeezing the string shoulder blade toward the spine. With the string elbow moving horizontally and the string shoulder blade moving toward the spine, the string fingers stop just behind the sternocleidomastoid, the muscle going vertically from the collar bone to the ear. Note: On the above elite archer it is very easy to verify that the string hand has kept the same shape as at full draw \n The release form generated by the string elbow moving a little up whilst squeezing the string shoulder blade toward the spine. With the string elbow moving diagonally a little up and backwards, the string fingers will come to rest on the upper chest just below the string side shoulder."}

The string elbow moving a little down while the shoulder blade moves towards the spine extension technique generates a very different form of release. Because the string elbow keeps going diagonally down and backward, the string hand ends up behind the archer’s head. \n The release form generated by the string elbow moving horizontally backward due to the string shoulder blade moving away from the spine. When the string elbow moves horizontally and the shoulder blade moves away from the spine, the string fingers stop just in front of (or against) the sternocleidomastoid, the muscle going vertically from the collar bone to the ear. Two variations of the above technique: • For a release generated by the string elbow moving a little up whilst moving the string shoulder blade away from the spine, the string fingers end up on the collar bone at the base of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. • For a release generated by the string elbow moving a little down whilst moving the string shoulder blade away from the spine, the string fingers finish their movement near the string ear. \nSince the shoulder blade motion is difficult to feel by many novices, the coach can refer to the direction of the string elbow as a guide. The area where the string hand ends is called the \"back end\". If the novice is using one draw expansion technique, but their release action corresponds to a different expansion technique, they are executing a movement upon release instead of “following-through” the muscular activity of their actual expansion technique. These are not proper releases and the artificial release movement must be corrected."}

The excess of relaxation will disappear gradually during the learning process. It is fundamental, however, that the novices implement the release by relaxing the finger flexors or at least by reducing their level of muscular contraction. For each successive arrow, increase the draw a little, until full draw is reached. When the string hand can no longer be directly observed because the string hand is under the chin, use a mirror to observe the hand during and after the release. During release the eyes follow the string hand’s follow-through. After release, the eye’s focus is on the string wrist's final position, as shown in the previous picture. Once the exercise has reached full draw, repeat it for a few ends. After some ends, the clicker can be introduced, if desired. The string hand should slide along the neck or jaw depending on the aiming system, never away from the neck or face. Always keep the string hand as relaxed as possible. Note: Try a deeper string grip if the novice cannot avoid either: • the knuckles standing out on the back of the string hand; or • The string wrist bending out. Continue this exercise following the standard teaching process: 1. Shoot with the eyes closed while concentrating on the string hand. 2. Same as 1, but with eyes open, looking up and unfocussed. 3. Same as 2, but looking and shooting at a blank butt. 4. Same as 3, but shooting at cut-out faces, starting from the 6 zone and continuing with smaller cut-outs right up to using a face with no cut-outs. \nThe Follow Through on Release - Exercise Objective: Release with constant string arm shape at the elbow. Rationale: The backward movement of the string arm is due to the follow-through of the activated muscles, i.e. mainly from the muscles from the posterior part of the string shoulder and from the back. Because the muscles from the string arm are not particularly involved, the arm shape should almost remain the same through the release process. Instructions: Standing about 4 meters from the butt, turn the head at full draw to observe the string elbow while ensuring: • The constant angle at the elbow; • The string elbow moves back in the same horizontal plane (more or less); • The pivoting/rotation motion of the string arm is at the shoulder joint. \n The above is valid for a natural expansion effort. If the novice is using a particular draw extension technique, the form of the release will vary accordingly."}

STRING CLEARANCE 6.13.1. Tests String Clearance of the Bow Forearm - Test With no hand on the string, raise the bow and check where the string is located on the armguard or forearm. About 12 mm in front of this spot (i.e. towards the bow) affix a piece of tape or an adhesive bandage which protrudes about 2 mm in the middle (bridge shape). The bridge of the tape should be fixed vertically, across the bow forearm/armguard, parallel to the string. \n A bridge of tape is an efficient way to check string clearance. Mark the side of the tape closest to the string with a pen (it is best to make the mark before sticking the tape on the armguard). This mark will help to identify if the string hits the tape while pushing the arrow or on its way back. \n Shoot an arrow with this tape in place - make sure the tape-bridge is not flattened out before the draw. After the shot, look at the tape and analyse any damage to it (if any). \nString Clearance at the Chest – Test Either with the novice watching him or herself in a mirror, or with the help of an assistant, observe at full draw where the string touches the chest, if it does. About 12 mm in front of this spot fix a piece of tape that has a bridge shape - 2 mm raised in the middle (an adhesive bandage is fine). \n Checking chest clearance with a bridge of tape. The most critical point is the edge (hem or trim) of the chest guard surrounding the bow shoulder. The bridge of tape should be fixed parallel to the string on the chest-guard. Shoot one arrow with this tape in place - pay attention to not flatten out the \"bridge\" part during the draw. After the shot, analyse any damage done to the tape. The following exercises will help to improve form and generate better string clearance. It is possible that poor string clearance may be caused by more than one issue. Thus it may be necessary to use several of following elements to attain good string clearance."}

Clothing Issue at the Chest or Sleeve - Rectification Tighten the garment sleeve at the forearm and at the top and along the bow arm at shoulder level using pins, bands or tape. \n \n The use of a chest-guard is often efficient as well. \n \nBow Shoulder Alignment – Rectification The bow shoulder joint should be kept in line with the string shoulder and bow hand, not pushed in towards the string. \n The bow shoulder should not be more toward the toes than in the example above. Below are some reminders on how to teach proper bow shoulder positioning. At the pre-draw: The joint should remain above the hipbone on the bow side. Moving this joint toward the string drastically reduces the string clearance. The bow arm may rotate clockwise (for a right-handed archer) in the shoulder joint, so long as the joint remains in the correct location. \n It should also be pushed down and forwards."}

Repeat with the bow but no arrow; then with an arrow and shooting. The coach must check that the bow shoulder is not brought too much inside (towards the arrow) during the draw and during the extension (full draw) actions, a common error for novices. The following exercises can help correct a bow shoulder that moves too far to the inside. During the draw: \n Position an arrow vertically against the front side of the bow shoulder of the novice during the pre-draw, holding the arrow with one hand at each end.

That said, the bow shoulder should remain above the hip, not further inwards (towards the toes). Ask the novice to draw with their eyes closed while the assistant helps with the vertical arrow to promote a better feeling of control and awareness of the bow shoulder position during the draw. During the extension (full draw): \n From the pre-draw, set up the shot as described in the previous situation. Once the novice is at full draw, firmly hold the arrow in place with one hand at each end. Keep the arrow still during the extension action, until one or two seconds after the release. Many novices have a tendency to twist their entire upper body instead of an extending in the arrow axis, particularly when learning to use a clicker. If this twist happens, the string clearance is dramatically reduced. Ask the novice to extend with the eyes closed while being assisted with the vertical arrow; it will help to better maintain the bow shoulder (and entire upper body) while extending at full draw. \nBow Elbow Orientation – Rectification The bow elbow should point away as shown below: \n If the bow elbow is not properly oriented this exercise can teach the novice how to properly rotate it.

Exercises Keeping a Relaxed Bow Hand - Exercise Objective: Develop a passive bow hand and fingers that do not apply any force to the riser which could create torque in the bow at full draw or during the arrow propulsion period. Simulations: The bow hand wrist is relaxed on the grip. Therefore when the grip moves forward just after the release, the wrist bends down. See the illustration below: \"Simulation of a relaxed bow hand at full draw and after release\". \n \n Simulation of a relaxed bow hand at full draw and after release.

The same exercise can also be done with a bow and an assistant: With the one hand, the assistant presses the riser against the bow hand of the novice. \n It is generally more convenient if the assistant works from behind the archer. The novice’s bow hand should be completely relaxed and conform to the angle of the bow grip. \n When the assistant suddenly pulls the riser away from the novice’s bow hand, the relaxed hand bends down."}

Equipment: Bow, no arrow is necessary. Instructions: The assistant tries to make the novice's fingers move to make the novice aware of their relaxation level. The novice keeps the bow arm in a relaxed horizontal position and looks at the fingers, or closes their eyes, and tries to relax the fingers. \n The assistant checks the relaxation of the bow hand fingers by touching them. If the novice has difficulty in relaxing their fingers, first get them make a firm fist around the bow grip as if they are strangling it, and then let them open the fist and thus relax. By doing this this they feel what relaxation actually means and can relax better and better. This is the basis of an exercise known as \"Progressive Muscle Relaxation,\" which is explained further in the level 2 manual. \nMaintaining a Relaxed Bow Hand Fingers – Exercise 2: 1. As an exercise to train the bow hand fingers to relax, have the novice hold a 2\" nail between the bow thumb and bow forefinger, as illustrated below. The length of the nail may vary slightly, depending on the width of the bow grip and the archer’s natural finger position. Roofing nails are usually ideal for this exercise. \n Bow hand fingers holding a nail. Watch the bow hand and fingers during the release. The nail should be pushed away by the riser and the novice should not have any residual feeling of the nail in any of the fingers. 2. For those who have some difficulty in implementing this exercise properly, add the following step. Watch the bow fingers in a mirror placed 50 cm ahead of the bow and a bit to the right (for right hand novices), showing the front of the riser and the fingers. Put the nail between the fingers every second arrow. 3. Shoot with eyes closed while concentrating on the bow hand. 4. Same as #3, but with eyes looking up and unfocused. 5.

The assistant braces one hand against the novice's string shoulder and draws the string slightly with their other hand, as illustrated below. The distance from the target is four to five meters. \n The novice’s bow arm has a natural reaction when executing this exercise. Important: The assistant braces one hand on the string shoulder of the novice in order to generate the proper body balance of the novice. Note to the assistant: Draw a little lower than normal, toward the novice's chest, to avoid hitting the novice in the face upon release. Equipment: The basic equipment set up, using a bow-sling, but not using the clicker, and a blank butt. \nInstructions: The assistant pulls the string to roughly 1/2 draw, pushing on the novice's string shoulder to maintain balance. The assistant aims the arrow, which is at the novice's shoulder height, visually towards the butt. The novice remains in an up-right position; with the bow shoulder lowered, and looking at the bow arm, not the butt. As the assistant releases, the novice's bow arm moves towards the side of the bow window and their body moves slightly towards the target. The novice continues this action alone while watching the bow arm at partial draw, then gradually increasing the draw length until full draw is reached. The novice continuously watches the bow arm during release, as shown below. To counteract the sideways movement of the bow arm the novice has to deliberately “push” the bow towards the target. This is an isometric push, without extension of the bow arm or elbow. \n \n Self-Observation of the bow arm at increasingly longer draw lengths.

Complementary knowledge When shooting, awareness and control of breathing is important as it influences the shooting process. Most novices inhale while starting a motion, or just before it; for example: • Moving to the shooting line; • Taking an arrow from the quiver; • Gripping the string/bow; • Raising the bow. Accurate tasks are characterized by holding of the breath for a little while, and then followed immediately by an exhale. For example, most novices: • Hold, then exhale while placing feet on shooting line; • Hold, then exhale while loading arrow on the bow string; • Hold, then exhale while placing the string-fingers and bow-hand; Usually, while pulling the string back - a movement with effort - a partial exhale happens. A common breathing pattern includes: -­‐ Breathe in while raising the bow; -­‐ Breathe out slightly while drawing; -­‐ Hold the breath while aiming and releasing; -­‐ Complete the exhale after the release. \n Breathing pattern while shooting.\n Continuity in breathing during the release: The importance of the consistency and standardization of breathing throughout the shooting routine cannot be overemphasized. All archers and, in particular novices, should change their focus and muscular activity as little as possible while releasing the string. Ideally the only change is that the tension in the string finger flexors decreases suddenly as they relax and allow the release to happen. Maintaining a consistent breathing attitude from aiming through the end of the follow-through helps in the novice's overall consistency, especially while the arrow is being “guided” by the string out of the bow. Most novices hold their breath while aiming and until approximately one second after release. If, however, the novice sometimes exhales just before or during the release, that indicates some change in the novice; usually a change in mental activity. Such changes should be minimised or avoided altogether. Controlling breathing: The coach should assist the novice in developing a breathing sequence that they can consistently implement, according to the above information. Do not be surprised if, during the first sessions on breathing sequences, the novices face the following difficulties: • Observing their current breathing pattern without modifying it; • Focusing on breathing while simultaneously maintaining the other steps of the shooting process. Often the novice says: \"My shots are better when I leave my breathing alone.\" If this happens, do not be alarmed, if it were easy it would not be a skill that needed to be taught. Discipline, repeated observation, awareness, concentration, and feeling of the breathing movements ensure the skill is integrated correctly in the shooting process. 6.15.2. Exercises No exercises are suggested for teaching the breathing sequence. \nLifting the bow arm. \n Pulling back the string. \nAiming and release. \n Follow through. \nInhale. \nExhale."}

Many are similar or have multiple uses for working on different aspects of the beginner’s form. While using them, it is likely that further variations and uses will be discovered by an open-minded coach. The sections are designed to be used on their own, or in combinations. Even an archer who has attained great skill in an area can improve through diligent training using these drills. As a coach, the challenge is to provide effective training for the beginners while keeping the experience enjoyable. There \nshould always be time for games or challenges so that the archers can see how they’ve improved through the drills they’ve completed. And of course there should be time for the beginners to shoot arrows just for the love of the sport, unencumbered by the pressures of an exercise or a competition. It is often during this free time that the archer most completely integrates the learning into their particular style."}

While the basics are being developed it is the coach’s responsibility to ensure that faults in the archer’s style do not become established. This implies that the basics being taught are correct and will not require significant interventions later. Most novices encounter common problems at some stage of their development as part of the learning process. Coaches should not only become familiar with these problems but also with the methods of overcoming them. A coach should focus the archer’s attention on the process not the result during training sessions. 7.1. The archer cannot close the non-dominant eye when aiming. \n Shooting with both eyes open will eventually enable the archer to concentrate on the correct sighting process but developing this style of aiming can be frustrating in the early stages. Refer to Chapter 4, paragraph 4.2.2.1, for how to determine which eye should be used during the sighting process. If the novice is unable to close their non-dominant eye its vision should be blocked. \na) An eye patch covering the non-dominant eye is one approach to solving the problem. b) Alternatively, a small opaque shield in a medium-density colour (beige or grey, for example) could be fixed to the peak of a cap or the brim of a hat and then lowered in front of the non-shooting eye. In this arrangement both eyes are open and fully able to focus, but the non-shooting eye has nothing to focus on, thereby allowing the shooting eye to focus on the target. 7.2. Shoulders moving up while raising the bow. \n If the physical weight of the bow and attachments are too heavy for the archer to control while bringing the bow to the pre-draw position, the shoulders will rise to compensate for the downward load being applied to the archer’s bow arm. To avoid this problem the coach has to teach the novice how to elevate the arm whilst keeping the shoulder low. Refer to chapters 6.5. “Body Pre-setting” and 6.6. “Raising the Bow” for details on how to solve this problem."}

Drawing the bow with the arm instead of the muscles from the posterior parts of the shoulders and the back. \n \n Drawing with the arm instead of the back is a very common problem faced by novices and one that cannot be solved while using a bow of any substantial draw weight. To get the feeling of the correct action of drawing the bow using the muscles in the back, without a bow, the beginner should simulate the action from Pre-Draw to Full Draw while concentrating on movements of the blades. Keeping their eyes closed will help the archer feel and understand the correct draw action step properly. Please refer to chapter 6.8. “Draw” for more information on teaching a proper draw action. Care should be taken to ensure that muscular activity is felt in the back part of the shoulders while drawing the bow. With little or no activity in the muscles in the back the drawing action will be instigated using the muscles in the drawing arm, which is undesirable. When the correct feeling has been established through mimicking without a bow, an elastic band should be used to introduce a light load to the drawing action. As confidence increases the load can be increased until a bow of appropriate weight can be used. From there, the use of a harness connecting the string elbow to the bow string with a rope is suggested. \n \n \n Focus should remain mainly on the beginning of the draw, followed by the eyes closed for a better feel of the action. To enable the correct drawing action to be established there should as little tension in the drawing hand or arm as possible. 7.4. Variations of string fingers pressure on the string. \n The most common reason for a finger slipping, lifting off the tab or not gripping the string consistently is a poor pre-setting of the wrist and fingers. Ensure that the archer is consistent in their drawing hand and wrist procedure."}

(b) If the problem persists, ask the novice to lift the middle finger when gripping the string. \n Let the middle finger lift, then get a grip in the string. \n Now the three fingers “work” the same. (c) Another correction worth considering is to place the string in the first joint of the index and ring fingers, then place the middle finger on the string where the string lays naturally i.e. between the first and second joints. (d) Ensure that the draw elbow position is consistent. Variations in the draw elbow position will alter the pressure on the fingers of the drawing hand. A high elbow will cause more pressure on the ring finger while a low elbow will change the pressure to the index finger."}

Moving head towards the string. \n Moving the head towards the string can be attributed to: (a) The archer trying to find a correct facial reference, e.g. trying to get the string to touch the tip of the nose when using the quadrilateral method of sighting. The string should be drawn to the facial reference rather than the head moving towards the string. Movement of the head towards the string uses more neck muscles, which increases tension in this area leading to muscular fatigue. If the muscles in the neck and shoulders are relaxed while drawing the bow, the head will not move towards the string. Refer to the “Neck and Shoulder Relaxation – Exercise” section in Chapter 6.9.2. for suggestions on how to improve head stability during draw. (b) A bow that has a draw weight that is too heavy for the archer to control will cause the archer to tire. This leads to the archer not drawing the bow to the same anchor position and thus moving their head to achieve the usual facial reference. (c) Incorrect use of a kisser button can also contribute to this problem. The archer moves their head to the kisser button instead of the kisser button being drawn to the appropriate facial reference. \n7.6. The arrow falls off the rest while drawing. (a) First the coach must check the body position. An overly tense right handed beginner may cant the top of the bow toward the left in the effort to pull the bow back. Beginners also often curve their back due to the physical weight of the bow, which can cause the arrow to drop down from the arrow-rest. (b) Another major cause of this problem is placing the fingers against the nock of the arrow prior to the commencement of the draw when using the Mediterranean Release, i.e. one finger above the arrow and two below. As the bow is drawn the angle of the string around the fingers becomes more acute causing the fingers to pinch the nock. The extra pressure of the middle string finger on the nock forces the arrow off the rest. This problem can be exaggerated by the use of a short bow by someone with a long draw length. The solution is to position the fingers, particularly the finger below the nock, so that there is no contact with the nock of the arrow prior to commencing to draw the bow. A finger tab fitted with a finger spacer between the index and second finger may help to correct this problem. (c) The next most common cause is increasing tension in the fingers or palm of the drawing hand while drawing the bow will cause the string to twist (anti clockwise for a right hand archer) which will cause the arrow to be pulled off the rest."}

The use of a light draw weight bow, elastic band or elastic string will aid the development of a draw length and facial reference that is appropriate for the archer. The archer should be encouraged to ensure that their weight is evenly distributed on both feet at full draw. d) A bow that is too heavy in draw weight may force the archer to use the entire upper body in drawing the bow causing the body to lean away from the target i.e. the weight being transferred onto the rear foot. This is particularly noticeable in archers shooting compound bows that have an excessive peak weight. e) Failure to push the bow shoulder forward to take the force generated by the bow being drawn will also cause the archer to lean towards the rear forcing body weight onto the rear foot. Refer to Chapter 6 Para. 6.1.2.4 for “Body Pre-setting”. f) Emphasis should be placed on an upright posture being maintained while raising the bow to the pre-draw position. The physical weight of the bow can cause the archer’s weight to be shifted to the rear foot to compensate for the weight of the bow being held at arm’s length from the body i.e. the archer’s centre of gravity moves backwards towards the string foot. This can also occur in more experienced archers who have too many or too long, attachments on their bows and lack the strength that is needed to hold the bow in the correct position. g) Lack of strength in the abdominal muscles can also cause this area to collapse during the drawing process allowing the archer to transfer weight towards the string foot. Strengthening of the abdominal muscles is essential to maintain correct posture. \n7.9. Bow shoulder moving upwards and backwards. \n The most common reasons for the bow shoulder moving upwards and backwards is: (a) Commencing the draw with the draw arm below shoulder height. As the load increases, the shoulder will shift to an unstable position. The draw should be commenced with the bow arm level to or above shoulder height. This ensures that, as the draw weight of the bow is exerted on the shoulder joint, the head of the humerus is pushed firmly into the glenoid fossa. This way the forces applied are taken efficiently by the skeletal system without the use of muscular activity. Section 6.6 “Raising the Bow” in Chapter 6 deals with this issue in greater detail. (b) The bow shoulder should be relaxed and held down. Refer to section 6.5.2 “Exercises” for practical techniques to properly set the shoulder. (c) Pushing forward with the shoulder while keeping the bow arm relaxed will enhance the position of the shoulder."}

Expanding at full draw with the arm instead of the muscles from the posterior parts of the shoulders and the back. Like drawing (see section 7.3.), at full draw expanding with the arm instead of the back, is a very common problem faced by novices and it cannot be solved while using a bow of any substantial draw weight. To get the feeling of the correct full draw expansion using the muscles in the back, without a bow, the archer should locate the string hand at their normal facial reference point and then concentrate on drawing the string shoulder blade towards the spine. \n The focus of the novice should be on the posterior part of the shoulders and the back. \n See Chapter 6.10. “Draw Expansion” for a more detailed description. Care should be taken to ensure that muscular activity is felt in the back. Without activity in the muscles in the back the expansion action will be instigated using the muscles in the drawing arm, which is undesirable. \nWhen the correct feeling has been established through mimicking without a bow, an elastic band should be used to introduce a light load to the extension action. As confidence increases the load can be increased until a bow of appropriate weight can be used. From there, the use of a harness connecting the string elbow to the bow string with a rope is suggested \n Eyes closed should help the novice to remain focused on the action of the muscles from the posterior parts of the shoulders and the back. To enable the correct extension action to be established there should a minimum of tension in the drawing hand or arm. For exercises for introducing a proper Draw Extension, please refer to section 6.10. in chapter 6. 7.11. Canting the bow whilst aiming. (a) An overly tense right handed beginner may cant the top of the bow toward the left in the effort to pull the bow back. Beginners also often curve their back due to the physical weight of the bow, which can cause the arrow to drop down from the arrow-rest. (b) Many novices cant the bow whilst aiming, generally to the right if a right handed archer and to the left if a left handed archer."}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0240", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 239, "page_start": 240, "page_end": 240, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  240 \n  \n This is primarily due to the bow hand not being set correctly on the bow grip during the set-up procedure. This in turn is generally caused by a novice gripping the bow with the bow hand because they are afraid of dropping the bow when the shot is made. The pressure point on the hand should be as shown in the illustration below, along with the bow elbow being rotated so that the elbow joint is at right angles to the bow. This means that the hollow of the elbow joint is parallel to the bow string. \n \n7.12. The string hits the bow arm, elbow or forearm. \n If the string hits any part of the arm it can be very painful and impede the archer’s progress by creating anxiety that the string may hit the arm on the next shot. This leads to the novice distorting the position of the bow arm to try to ensure string clearance. This problem can be caused by: (a) Bows with a low brace height, which will allow the string to make contact with the lower part of the forearm. It is better to have the brace height on the higher side of its range for novice archers to ensure that the string travel is not interrupted by contact with the arm. (b) Incorrect placement of the hand on the bow. For correct placement refer to section 6.4.1 Complementary Knowledge from chapter 6.4. BOW HAND AND ELBOW The usual cause of this is the archer gripping the bow too tightly. The archer should place their hand in the bow with the fingers relaxed, the knuckles away from the bow at an angle of between 30o to 45o and the heel of the hand not touching the bow. (c) Incorrect position of the bow arm elbow. At full draw the elbow should not be pointed towards the ground but should be pointed at right angles to \nThe pressure on the bow grip should be here. \nThis area should not touch the bow grip."}

For more details, please refer to the same section as in (b). (d) Allowing the bow shoulder to move forward or inwards (i.e. towards the bow) will bring the whole arm into the path of the string. The archer should set their shoulder low and push towards the target without allowing it to roll forwards or inwards. The coach should ensure that the archer understands that the push comes from the shoulder and not from the hand or arm. 7.13. Grabbing the bow upon release. \n  \n Grabbing the bow is usually associated with the archer being afraid of dropping the bow as it jumps forward on release. The bow’s movement should be natural and dynamic on release, uninfluenced by the archer’s bow hand. Introduction of a finger sling or wrist sling will help to alleviate the fear of dropping the bow and encourage a more passive bow hand. A very relaxed bow hand will promote a more consistent launch of the arrow and better results at the target. To encourage a more relaxed bow hand, refer to the exercises under section 6.14.2 from the chapter 6.14. “Follow-Through”. This problem can also be associated with the archer diverting concentration from staying focused on the process of “following-through” to watching the arrow impact the target. Ensure that the archer’s attention remains on the execution of a good shot. \n7.14. Target panic. \n Target Panic is a psychological problem that takes on various forms when an archer faces the target. It is not generally associated with novice archers but can occur at any stage of an archer’s development. \n As all forms of target panic are psychological the only cure for the problem is to divert the archer’s attention from the problem area and have them concentrate on other aspects of their form. It is imperative to correct any indication of target panic before it becomes established. Some of the forms that target panic may take are: (a) Inability to sight on the point of aim (Gold Shy). (b) Involuntary release as soon as the sight nears the point of aim. (c) Discontinuing the aiming process prior to release. (d) Premature release. (e) Inability to release the arrow. Any of these problems rarely arise if the archer is taught sound basic form with the emphasis being placed on the process of shooting the arrow rather than the outcome or score. Target Panic can be caused by lack of confidence in some part of the archer’s basic form, which diverts the archer’s"}

Confidence in the fundamentals of their basic style has to be established by the archer so that there is no cause for the archer’s concentration to be diverted from the sighting task. (a) Practice with eyes closed at short distances from the target will help to alleviate areas of concern in the archer’s basic form. When shooting at close range with closed eyes, it is important for the novice to understand fully why they are doing it. Mindless repetition of shot after shot with no understanding will not lead to any progress. The reason for this shooting process is that at the short range the archer cannot miss the target and can, therefore, concentrate on all the other aspects of the performance of a good shot. In other words the archer has to be mindful of the feel of the good shot in his mind, to get to know the smooth flow of effort from the start of the draw to the follow-through. Ideally short-range shooting should involve guidance from the coach. (b) Emphasis should be placed on the archer maintaining their head in an upright position with both eyes firmly fixed on the centre of the target before commencing the drawing process. The act of aiming (aligning the sight with the target) should only commence after the archer has come to full draw and established their facial reference. Starting to aim too early in the archer’s set up will inhibit their ability to maintain concentration on the process. For example, if aiming is started as the draw commences the archer’s focus is directed towards holding the sight on the target and other aspects of the archer’s form are neglected. Starting too early can lead to focus on the aiming process being maintained over an extended period, causing a loss of concentration, leading to the aiming process being aborted prematurely. \n After coming to full draw with the correct facial reference, obtaining the correct sight picture and releasing should take no more than 2 to 3 seconds for a recurve archer. For archers using a sight, the removal of the post and pin from the sight and using the ring sight only alleviates the need to hold the pin on the point of aim. By doing this, the sighting process becomes less critical and allows the archer to concentrate on other areas of their form. Without a definite aiming point in the sight the subconscious mind will take over and centre the point of aim within the sight ring. Placing too much emphasis on the sighting process is a major contributor to target panic. The archer should be encouraged to realize that sighting is only one of the stages that encompass the launching of an arrow towards the target and is not the critical area in the process (c) The inability to release the string may be caused by tension in the draw hand. \n The exercise described in section 6.12.2 will allow the archer to become accustomed to relaxing the string hand while simulating the release action without the use of a bow. The novice can gain confidence in their release by practicing with an elastic band. Varying the length of the band to increase the tension as the archer’s confidence in their release grows will help them transition to using a bow of"}

This exercise should start at 2 to 3 meters from the target, increasing the distance as the archer’s confidence grows. During the release emphasis should be placed on relaxing the fingers rather than releasing the string. e) Some forms of target panic can be cured by the use of a clicker which is used as both a draw length check and release generator. The correct use of a clicker diverts the archer’s attention from the sighting process to the use of the muscles controlling the drawing and release of the arrow. Emphasis needs to be placed on setting the clicker to the correct draw length of the archer and ensuring that the archer understands the procedure to draw the arrow through the clicker. A clicker gives an audible signal to release the string but should not be used as a trigger if the sight is not centred on the point of aim. Emphasis should be placed on the archer controlling the shot; if the shot is properly set up and executed the clicker will indicate the correct draw length. That being said, a clicker should not be introduced until the archer’s form is consistent and an understanding of executing the shot by the use of the muscles in the back is fully understood. f) Some other methods to try to cure the problem of “gold shy” are: • Temporarily use a bow that the draw weight poundage is lower than the bow normally used • Use the “dry fire” system, see section 5.2.1 • Temporarily change the shooting side. When ease and confidence are encountered on the non-dominant side, alternate shots from side to side while \nprogressively allowing more shots with the original side."}

Consequently, only the specific differences in the learning process as compared to the other forms of archery are covered. Refer to the other chapters of this manual for general archery coaching techniques and information. 8.1. Equipment 8.1.1. Bow: WORLD ARCHERY defines a “traditional bow” as one that is contained in one of the following divisions: “English Longbow,” “American Flatbow,” “Longbow,” and “Traditional Recurve”. For competitions WA defines traditional bows as the following divisions: Longbow and Instinctive Bow. The WA traditional divisions are slightly restrictive as, in general terms, a “traditional bow” includes any bow from the primitive bent stick to a modern traditional recurve bow. There are other traditional bows that are not included in World Archery events, such as “Yumi” for Kyudo, bows used on horseback, etc. Broadly speaking, the more ancient and primitive the design of the bow, the harder it is to be precise while shooting. In other words, the same archer will almost always score better with a modern traditional recurve than with an English Longbow. The differences in performance are a consequence of the geometry, balance and efficiency of the different designs. Nonetheless, an archer can enjoy and strive to shoot their best with any traditional bow. \n \n8.1.2. Arrows Traditional arrows may be made of wood, aluminium alloy or carbon and maybe fitted with feathers or vanes. Shooting with vanes only works properly when the bow has an arrow rest. Feathers are much better when the arrows are shot from the shelf. For competition purposes, the archers must ensure that their arrows comply with the rules of the division in which they wish to compete. 8.1.3. String Finger Protector A tab or shooting glove is a protective piece, usually made of leather that covers the string fingers while shooting. The bow string can put a large amount of pressure on an archer’s string fingers, causing pain – especially at higher draw weights. In order to prevent this discomfort, and its detrimental effects on the loose of the bowstring, some form of finger protection is necessary. A finger tab is usually the best solution for protecting the fingers while maintaining accuracy. However, some archers find a tab to be difficult to use or uncomfortable. In these cases a shooting glove that covers the string fingers may be used instead. \n 8.1.4. Bow Hand Armguard/Glove Longbows often have a lower brace height than modern recurves. Thus it is quite normal for the string to touch or even hit the forearm on almost every shot. An armguard is a piece of protective gear that covers the forearm and prevents the string from striking it. Traditional archers usually use a large and substantial armguard to provide the tough protection that the forearm requires."}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0246", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 245, "page_start": 246, "page_end": 246, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  246 \n Additionally, a bow hand glove may be necessary for archers shooting some historical bows such as the English longbow. These bows are designed without an arrow shelf, so the arrow rests directly on top of the bow hand. Natural feathers in particular may have a rough quill that can hurt the archer’s hand as the arrow leaves the bow. Usually bow hand gloves for traditional shooters protect only the thumb, forefinger and the space in between. 8.1.5. Bow Sling A bow sling is a device used to promote a relaxed bow hand and prevent the archer from dropping his or her bow. Bow slings are permitted in all divisions, but are mainly useful in modern recurve bows with a pistol grip. The sling prevents the bow from jumping out of the bow hand during the action and reaction of the release. Archers who shoot a longbow tend to hold the bow with a light grip, preventing the bow from jumping out of the hand. This grip should be light enough to stop the bow from falling to the ground but not so tight as to cause torque to be applied to the bow. \n   \n  \n8.2. Form Reminder: This chapter highlights a few key differences with the other forms of archery covered in the other chapters of this manual. The archer’s form when shooting a traditional bow must be kept as close as possible to the standard form any beginner would learn. This being the case, most of the exercises to teach the correct shooting technique for a traditional bow can be taken from chapter 6. \n 8.2.1. Stance. At least two different stances are used in traditional archery. Some traditional archers adopt an upright stance, similar to the stance of target archers, and hold their bow vertically. \n A traditional shooter with an upright stance"}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0247", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 246, "page_start": 247, "page_end": 247, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  247 \nOthers, particularly those shooting instinctively or intuitively, bend the knees slightly and flex the upper body slightly forward. In this stance, the bow is canted to maintain a right angle between the bow and the eye axis. \n Traditional shooters using a tilted stance. Note the right angle between the eye axis and the bow on the left picture from Dietmar VORDEREGGER 8.2.2. Binocular vision and Dominant Eye. \n Shooting with both eyes open will help novices reach their best level in traditional archery, whatever the aiming method used, and it is especially important if unconscious references are used (i.e. intuitive or instinctive aiming). Hence shooting with both eyes open is recommended when shooting traditional archery. To be truly effective when shooting with both eyes open, it is paramount that the archer shoot according to their eye dominance. Binocular vision allows your brain to estimate distances while reducing anxiety and peeping/peeking tendencies that often result from the lack of a sight. The dominant eye focusses on the target and watches the direction of the arrow subconsciously. At the same time, the non-dominant eye completes the visual information, allowing the brain to estimate distance and trajectory. Ways to determine the dominant eye can be found in chapter 4 of this manual. A method \nrecommended for the traditional archer to determine the dominant eye can be found in section 4.2.4.1. Based on this, the novice traditional archer should shoot right or left handed. Following the dominant eye criteria will stand the archer in good stead for better results in the future. 8.2.3. Bow Hand The shape of the grip on a longbow usually forces the archer to have a low wrist. Nevertheless, the pressure exerted by the bow hand on the grip is more or less the same as in shooting an Olympic recurve. Pressure must be kept on the top half of the bow's grip, with the bow hand and fingers as relaxed as possible. The archer should feel a uniform pressure of the bow in the web of the bow hand above the lifeline (i.e. between the life line and the root of the thumb). This pressure zone is in line with the radius bone in the forearm and allows the force of the bow's draw weight to be transferred efficiently through the hand and wrist directly in line with the arm bones."}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0248", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 247, "page_start": 248, "page_end": 248, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  248 \n8.2.4. Bow Arm/Elbow Due to the “kick” of many designs of traditional bows the archer’s bow arm has to be straight, or almost straight but not locked. It must be straight enough to be consistent and stable for every shot, as well as staying steady when releasing the string. Keeping the arm not locked will help prevent future repetitive use injuries in the elbow and shoulder. \n 8.2.5. String grip Most novices should start with the usual string grip with the index finger above and the middle and ring fingers below the nock on the string. The grip should hold the string between the second and third joints of the fingers. For a novice struggling with this string grip, three fingers below the nock is an acceptable alternative. 8.2.6. Canting the Bow Canting is the act of holding the bow so that the limb tips are not vertically aligned. \n Common bow canting \nModern traditional recurve bows can be held and shot vertically, while ancient designs could need up to a 20-degree cant to be consistent. A slight cant of the bow allows the archer to see the aiming spot with both eyes and keep the arrow aligned with the dominant eye. It is important to note that canting the bow doesn’t mean canting the hand. The canting should come from the inclination of the body toward the toes. The hand position must be as close as possible to the standard form by holding the bow with a relaxed hand, even on a straight grip longbow. A right-handed archer will cant their bow “to the right,” meaning that the top limb tip is further to the right compared to the target than the bottom limb tip. If a right-handed archer were to cant their bow to the left, they would risk the arrow falling off the shelf, rest or bow hand with unpredictable and potentially dangerous consequences. Naturally, a left-handed archer will do the opposite. To determine the proper angle of cant, the archer should try to hit a line drawn vertically down the centre of the target. The more the archer cants the bow to the right, for a right-handed archer, the more the arrow will go to the right. Hence if arrows hit left side of the line, the canting angle is too small and vice-versa if an arrow hits on the right side. Naturally, left-handed archers will respond to the mirror-reflection of this concept. This canting of the bow will have very little effect on close targets but will have a large effect on mid-to-long range targets American flatbows are designed to be canted until the window is vertical. Other bows without window or even arrow-rest has to be canted more because the arrow points more to the left (for a right-handed archer). \n Novices can learn to use the same canting angle through the following exercise: Have the archer shoot from a distance of five to ten meters at a target butt that has a piece of visible tape affixed at the correct angle for the"}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0249", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 248, "page_start": 249, "page_end": 249, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  249 \nbow. When the archer raises the bow, they can check the canting angle by comparing the bow with the tape and making any adjustments necessary to bring the bow into line with the tape. This exercise can also be done with closed eyes after obtaining the correct stance. The archer should open their eyes when the drawing hand reaches the anchor point. \n 8.2.7. Facial Marks/Anchor and Forces Alignment The most common facial reference mark for a traditional shooter is to place the tip of the index finger next to the teeth and touching the corner of the mouth. This reference usually positions the arrow directly below the dominant eye when the archer is using proper form. Different face shapes, however, could lead to some differences in the ideal anchor position. To be most consistent, two more references are desirable; the thumb under the lower jaw and the first joint of the first finger below cheek-bone. \n \nTo control the proper draw length, the coach should stand beside the archer, giving feedback on the archer’s form and references. This should be repeated several times until the archer can feel the correct facial reference point. Using a mirror to let the archer watch and verify their own forces alignment (arrow / string forearm alignment) and anchor position will further reinforce this feedback. During this process the coach must help the archer to find the correct overall feeling and body sensations, including their bow arm, drawing elbow, shoulders, bow elbow, chest and upper body position, and back tension in addition to their to facial marks. \n Note that changing the facial marks (anchor) and/or using different arrow lengths, are not allowed during a single competition. Hence it is not recommended to teach the beginners to use two facial marks (a technique called “Face Walking”); one for short distances and one for “long” distances. Face walking is sometimes considered when shooting at longer distances with light bows in order to keep the point of the arrow close to the centre of the target while aiming. Similarly it is not recommended to have the novices use different sets of arrows for different shooting distances. For the other components of shooting form please refer to chapters 1 and 6 of this manual."}

Aiming methods Through experience and depending on the shooting distance, beginners may use various references or aiming methods; here are the most popular ones in traditional archery. 8.3.1. Without Conscious References Commonly known as “instinctive” (although there is no truly instinctive aiming in archery) or “intuitive” shooting, this method uses the natural abilities of humans to aim and throw things. Senses, perception, intuition, kinaesthetic sensations, and the brain’s calculating capacity all combine to aim the bow and arrow. They are the same abilities that are used in any ball sport or when throwing a simple paper ball into a trash basket, for example. It is based on practice, trial-and-error, correction, and repetition. It is the most natural and ancient method and it has allowed humans to use the bow and arrow as a weapon for millennia. One of the most important facets of intuitive aiming is that the position where the nock touches the string should be precisely aligned vertically under the aiming eye. For this style of aiming, the coach must advise the archer to watch the centre of the mark, or the smallest spot visible on target as focal point. Subconscious references are better for moving targets, speed shooting and close distances. \n For beginners, the intuitive method is the easiest and most natural to learn, and allows the archer to enjoy shooting at its best. \n8.3.2. With Conscious References An archer using a conscious reference point has to first evaluate the shooting distance, and then, depending on the estimated shooting distance, has to set the arrow point a related place on the target face. From this point, two aiming options are possible: o Focussing the visual attention where the arrow point is located; o Keeping the arrow point in the peripheral vision and focusing on the centre of the target. 8.3.2.1. Visual focus on a particular spot of the target face This aiming technique is also called Point-on Aiming Distance Method, or POD. The first requirement of this aiming method is to determine the shooting distance at which, in order to hit the target’s centre, the arrow point is visually positioned on centre of the target face or spot, when the archer is aiming at full draw. It is usually 30m or less if three string fingers are under the arrow and 30m or more with the Mediterranean string finger grip. From this reference distance, the arrow point’s visual location while aiming changes in height as the archer moves closer to or further from their target. For closer distances, the archer chooses a location on the target face that is below the spot and focuses on this location. For longer distances, the archer chooses and focusses on a mark above the spot. In this method, once the archer has set the arrow point at the proper spot, he focuses on that spot, not the centre of the target (unless on POD). \n The shooting distance allowing the archer to direct the arrow point at the centre of the target face"}

The advantage here is that the archer focusses on the high spot; hence is not disturbed by not seeing the centre of the target (as in Gap Shooting). When the tip of the arrow is seen close to the centre or above, this aiming method is effective. However, when shooting a small target at 5m for example, the next method below in which the beginner focusses on the centre of the target often performs better than choosing a spot on the grass. 8.3.2.2. Visual focus on the centre of the target face This method is known as “Gap Shooting”. It is when the archer consciously uses the distance (gap) between the tip of the arrow and the centre of the target as an aiming aid. In this aiming style the main visual focus is always on the centre of the target or spot. \n This method works well from zero distance to the POD. Beyond this distance, the arrow shaft covers the view of the centre of the target, the gap disappears, and it becomes impossible for the archer to focus on the centre of the target or spot. 8.3.3.3. Aiming follow-through It is natural for any archer to be tempted to watch the arrow in flight, but this is generally detrimental to the aiming process. Ideally, the archer’s focus will be always on the spot or reference chosen until the arrow hits the target. \n8.4. Traditional Archery Training and Practice The effect that the size and shape of the target face has on accuracy is tremendous for archers aiming intuitively. The Standard Teaching Process presented in chapter 6 of this manual is also valid for the level 1 traditional archery coach. The adaptation of the shooting skills and sequence of the traditional archer works best by initially shooting at targets that are easy to focus on and gradually progressing the archer through more difficult targets. Small, three-dimensional, bright-coloured, centred single-spots against a large, dark background are the easiest targets to focus on and deliver good groupings quite naturally. For example a little red balloon or a tennis ball against large black paper or rubber backing is a good starting target. \n In this case, the archer focusses automatically on the spot without any effort at all. This scenario makes the archer feel confident, with little chance of missing the butt, and allows easy tight grouping. Multiple, un-centred, multi-coloured targets on similar backgrounds are the hardest to focus on, make the archer hesitate or have doubt about the result, and generally produce poor grouping."}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0252", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 251, "page_start": 252, "page_end": 252, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  252 \n A three-spot World Archery target face placed close to the edge of the butt is an example of a poor choice of targets for a beginner. Always start with “easy” targets and at close distances until good grouping appears, and then change only one variable at a time. After the archer masters consistent technique, different distances can be introduced. Start with shooting at 40-cm World Archery face at a distance of 5m. As soon as 3 arrows are constantly hitting within the red circles move the archer back to 7.5m, then to 10m and to 12.5m. At the distance of 15m and 17.5m the 3 arrows should hit within the blue circle. From 20 m, the increment of the shooting distance can be of 2.5 or 5m pending the accuracy of the beginner. At the distance of 20m, 25m and 30m the 3 arrows should be within the black circle and finally at the distances of 35m, 40m and 45m the 3 arrows should be within the white circle. This is a good exercise to go through every year before the outdoor season starts. To develop and practice the ability to keep focused, have the archer shoot from different distances. Changing the shooting distance within a training session helps to develop the subconscious mechanism of adjusting the aiming references to the new shooting distance. When the archers have mastered controlling their focus at different distances, distractions such as flags, colourful balloons, ribbons, or similar items can be added to the targets. This helps to improve concentration, especially on a windy day. Since motion attracts focus, it is very difficult to keep these extra items from diverting the archer’s focus from the target. \n8.5. Basic Tips for Maintenance of Traditional Archery Equipment 8.5.1. The Bow A traditional bow will perform well for many years if a few simple procedures are followed to keep it well maintained: • Between shooting sessions, traditional bows are best stored horizontally, unstrung and in a cool, climate-controlled room. • Archers should always use a bow stringer when stringing and unstringing their bow. • Ideally the bow will be kept at a consistent bracing height for each shooting session. An easy way to promote a consistent bracing height is to keep the same number of twists in the string. Thus, when unstringing the bow, it is a good idea to either leave the string on the bow, or to lock the string loops when taking the string off the bow. To lock the string loops, simply feed one through the other and then vice-versa. Doing this will keep the string at a consistent length and therefore a consistent bracing height. It is still a good idea to measure the bracing height from time to time, especially before tournaments, to make sure it is at the right level. • Extreme heat may cause damage to the bow, so it should not be left in a car during summertime or near a heater, for example. • Putting the bow in a breathable fabric cover will prevent damage during transport. • In the case of a long journey, for example by plane, it is wise to put the bow (longbow or one-piece bow) into a plastic tube for extra protection. The equipment, up to 2 long tubes for bows and 4 smaller tubes for arrows, usually fit comfortably in a ski-bag. • String walking (adapting the height of the location of the string fingers on the string to correspond with changes in shooting distance) with a traditional bow causes unequal stress to the limbs and may eventually cause a catastrophic failure of the bow. • Only the owner of a traditional bow should shoot it. This is especially true when considering allowing archers with longer draw lengths than the owner to shoot the bow."}

Arrows Traditional arrows require attention and maintenance to keep them straight and undamaged between shooting sessions. • Arrows should be stored vertically with enough space for the feathers. This way they will not touch each other and cause damage. Ideally, traditional arrows are stored by hanging the arrows upside down with the point stuck to a magnet. • Wet arrows should not to be left in the quiver. They should be dried while hanging or standing vertically with enough space for the feathers to be free from any contact. • Storing natural feathers near a piece of cedar or using cedar shafts for your arrows will discourage moths from damaging them as they do not like cedar. • The nock of the arrow has to fit the string. Nocks that are too loose on the string may slip off causing the archer to dry fire the bow, which can seriously damage the bow. Consequently, nocks that are too loose should be replaced. • If the nock is too tight on the string there is the possibility of it breaking during release making the arrow deviate from its intended flight path. A nock that is too tight may also damage the string. In a worst case situation the string could be broken. Therefore, nocks that are too tight should also be replaced. • Wooden arrow shafts require extra care for safety and consistency. Inspect all shafts for damage after use and discard if any damage is evident. An arrow breaking on release could damage the bow or cause a severe injury to the bow hand or forearm. • If the quill of the feathers is injuring the archer’s hand, then adding a drop of glue to the front of the feather or raising the nocking point may help. \n8.5.3. The String A bow string will shoot optimally for many arrows if it is maintained properly. Here are a few key elements to keep an eye on for ideal string maintenance and wear: • A (Dacron) string should be waxed from time to time to keep the strands together. • To avoid the string breaking it is recommended to check it regularly for damage. Depending on the string material, after several thousand shots, it will need to be replaced • The string has to suit the bow, with the recommendations of the manufacturer being respected. The material and number of strands are related to the bow’s draw-weight and construction. Care must be taken to ensure compatibility of these factors. 8.6. Conclusion Like all archers, traditional shooters have the goal of shooting the centre of a target. Traditional archery comes with its own unique set of challenges, but the reward of hitting a target with minimal aids one that is respected by all knowledgeable archers. Using proper technique and efficient equipment maintenance, this most primitive form of the sport can be an effective and fun demand on the skill of any athlete."}

PRELIMINARIES For an archery course to be successful, there are certain items that must be available, in good condition and ready for each lesson. The coach must have the knowledge to properly set up and maintain the equipment throughout the program. The coach must also progressively introduce and explain the equipment to the novices. Take care to not overburden them with too much information at once. Since a certain proportion of athletes are left handed, about 20% of the available equipment should be for those who will shoot left handed and the rest for the right handed archers in the group. In some countries, and among some ethnical groups, this percentage has to be strongly modified. 9. 2. SHOOTING SIDE Since some shooting accoutrements are specific to the shooting side, each novice’s shooting side should be identified before selecting their equipment. The shooting side can be selected either according to dominant eye or by dominant (preferred) hand. However the shooting side is selected, be sure that the novice can aim with the eye on that side. This means that either the eye dominance matches the shooting side, or the archer can close the non-aiming eye without interfering with the shot. In a pinch, an eye patch can be used to cover the non-aiming eye. See chapter 4.2.4.1. Shooting side choice 9.3. THE BOW 9.3.1. Bow description: Refer to the illustration below while introducing the various parts of the bow to the novices. \n Most modern entry-level bows are takedown recurves – i.e. the limbs can be removed from the riser and used in a right or left handed riser. \n The risers are mainly manufactured for one shooting side only, though some manufacturers do make ambidextrous bows that can be used by both right handed and left handed archers. The obvious advantage of the ambidextrous bows is offset by some significant issues. For example, a riser with two windows above the bow hand may bend due to the thin material between these two windows. Another common issue is difficulty in properly aligning the arrow in the centre of the bow. \n \nUpper limb Arrow rest Hand position Back of the bow Lower limb \nString Centre serving Nocking point Bracing height Front of the bow"}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0255", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 254, "page_start": 255, "page_end": 255, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  255 \n  \nIdeally each novice will be assigned to his or her own bow for the duration of the session or program. However, it is also acceptable for two compatible novices to share a bow. \n  9.3.2. Bracing/Stringing a bow: Stringing a bow should always be done using a proper bow stringing tool to ensure the safety of both the person and the equipment. The most common bow stringing device is pictured below and is available from most archery shops. \n A simple loop of rope is much cheaper, convenient and safe as shown below. Note that when using this type of bow stringer, you must protect the limb tip that presses into the ground. A small rubber disk or a foam or leather pad will suffice to prevent damage to the limb tip. \n In a permanent archery range there may be a “bow bracer” like the one pictured below fixed to a wall or a pillar. \n There are several other bracing methods, but we recommend these as the simplest and safest for novices. 9.3.3. Brace height (also called string height): A bow’s brace height is measured from the deepest part of the bow grip to the string or from the string to the pressure button. Always check the manufacturer’s recommendation to ascertain the correct measurement for the bow being used. If the information is not available, use the brace height chart below as a guide. Bow Height Brace Height range Brace Height (cm.) 64 inches 19,7 -22,9 cm 21,5 cm 66 inches 20,3 – 23,5cm 22 cm 68 inches 21 – 24,1cm 22,5 cm 70 inches 21,6 – 24,8cm 23 cm Train the beginners to periodically check the brace height of their assigned bow. They should make sure it is the same or still within the range as strings, especially those made of Dacron, stretch and change over time. Also, twists may be unintentionally added or removed if the string is taken off the bow for storage or transport. An excessively high bracing height will not be good for the bow and will shorten the power stroke, effectively reducing the power of the bow. Alternatively, if the bow is used with the bracing height too low, the bow will be unstable and the string will, more than likely, strike the archer’s wrist. The bracing height can be adjusted by adding or removing twists in the bow string. Adding twists to the string reduces its length which in turn increases the bracing height. Removing twists lengthens the string, which in turn decreases the bracing height."}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0256", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 255, "page_start": 256, "page_end": 256, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  256 \n  \n9.3.4. Bow length: Bows come in different lengths, the most common lengths for recurves are 66 inch and 68 inch. Bows of these lengths can accommodate most novice archers. The 66 inch bow would be for those using arrows up to 27 ½ inches in length, and 68 inch bow would be for those shooting arrows for 27 ½ inches and more. The following chart shows a bow length suggestion for different draw lengths of the novice. Novices Draw length Bow length Up to 18” 48” 18” to 20½” 52” (or longer) 20½” to 23½” 62” (or longer) 23½” to 25½” 64” (or longer) 25½” to 27½” 66” (or longer) 27½” to 29½” 68” (or longer) 29½” to 31” 70” (or longer) More than 31” 72” If a short bow is selected for a novice who has a long draw length the limbs will bend more than they are designed for and may even break if they are drawn beyond their limit. Also, the string will make a sharp angle at the point of draw and could pinch the fingers of the novice reducing the efficiency of the release. The illustration below shows the angle of the string for long and short bows drawn to the same draw length. \n A bow that is too long for an archer that has a short draw length will not be very efficient because the recurves aren’t opened enough. This would cause the arrow to drop more quickly, necessitating that the sight block be placed lower down the sight rack when longer distances are being shot and it could be harder to aim. \n9.3.5. Bow weight: Bows come in different draw weights, some are adjustable and some are set to predetermined poundage. Select a bow for each novice that is appropriate for their age and physique. The chart below suggests bow weights based on normal age and gender ability levels, but be sure to account for each novice’s specific needs. Gender Age - years Bow weight (max.) Children 6 to 8 Up to 10 pounds Children 8 to 12 Up to 12 pounds Girls 12 to 14 12 to 16 Pounds Boys 12 to 16 14 to 18 Pounds Girls 15 to 17 15 to 18 Pounds Boys 15 to 17 16 to 20 Pounds Women 16 to 20 Pounds Men 18 to 22 Pounds Through practice, the novice will be able to progress to a heavier bow. Do not increase the draw weight of the novices bow too soon, and never increase the bow weight more than two pounds at a time. The following chart shows a test that can be used to check the “archery strength” of an archer: Time in seconds Action 1 Start elevating the bow 2 – 7 Complete opening the bow 8 Relax the bow down 9 – 10 Get a rest The novice should be able to do the above 8 times without loss of form. If the novice can do this 10 or 12 times without any loss of form consider increasing the bow weight by 2 pounds. It is sometimes possible to slightly change the bow weight of bows that are not fitted with a system of weight adjustment. Usually such bows have the limbs fixed to the riser with a large bolt. To adjust the weight, insert a piece of hard wood or plastic, approximately 1 to 2 millimetres thick, into the limb pocket to change the angle made between the limb and the riser."}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0257", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 256, "page_start": 257, "page_end": 257, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  257 \n  \n To keep the limbs balanced, a piece of the same thickness must be inserted in both the top and bottom limb pockets. By fitting these similar pieces of wood or plastic the bow will be made heavier. Be careful not to make the inserted piece too thick and always ensure there is enough of the fixing bolt threaded into the riser for safety. Calculating Draw Weight: The actual draw weight an archer achieves at full draw depends partially on their draw length as well as the marked weight of the limbs on their bow. The Archery Trade Association (ATA) uses a standard measurement of 28 inches of draw length for determining the draw weight marked on limbs. The 28 inch length is defined as the Draw Length to Pivot Point (D.L.P.P) plus 1 3/4 inches. The D.L.P.P is the distance from the throat of the nock to the point on the riser directly above the pivot point of the grip. This method is depicted in the following illustration. \n \nIf an archer draws the bow less than the standard as shown above the draw weight will be reduced by 1½ to 2 pounds per inch of draw length difference. Conversely, if the archer draws the bow more than the standard shown above the draw weight will be increased by 1½ to 2 pounds per inch of the increased draw. 9.4. ARROWS: 9.4.1. Arrow description: Refer to the illustration below to explain the parts of the arrows i.e. nock, point and fletchings etcetera. You must also tell the beginners how the arrows must be treated and carried to avoid any injury as the points and nocks may be quite sharp. \n 9.4.2. Arrow material: The shaft of the arrow can be made of wood, fiberglass, aluminium, carbon and at advanced levels a combination of aluminium and carbon. Because wooden arrows break easily and fiberglass arrows are heavy, aluminium arrows and carbon arrows are the most popular at the entry level. Both have advantages and disadvantages. Aluminium arrows are considered to be stable and forgiving, but they are a little heavy and slow. Also, they can bend, particularly the light ones used with light entry-level bows, when pulled out of the target by the novices. Carbon arrows are lighter, faster, and cannot be bent. If the carbon fibres are straight, they crack easily and can become dangerous. Nowadays there are many models made with crossed carbon fibres that are very resistant. Avoid nocks that fit on the outside of carbon arrows. If the arrows are improperly matched with the bow weight, they often hit the arrow-rest or even the bow window upon exit. Be aware that if carbon arrows are used, all arrows that miss the target must be found before leaving the field. This is critical if the field is a multi-use sports field as broken carbon shafts can cause significant injury to the others using the space. Carbon arrows that do not have a metal core cannot be found using a metal detector unless the metal point is of a sufficient size that the metal detector is able to locate it. \nPosition of inserted a small piece of wood or plastic. \nPosition of inserted a similar piece of wood or plastic. \nMeasured draw length = Nocking point to the far side of the bow.

Arrow identification: Many arrow shafts look the same in most respects, especially to beginning archers. Thus it is important have a selection of arrows that are distinctive enough to be told apart by novices. The most common method for this is to have a set of arrows with a unique colour combination of fletching and nocks for each archer. It is usual to have three fletchings on each arrow 120 degrees apart, with the cock fletching a different colour than the other two for easy recognition by the novice. \n Use larger fletches or vanes for stability and to slow down the arrow flight for easier arrow finding should they miss the target. The recommended length of fletching or vanes is 2 ¾”, or a little longer (up to 3”). A more advanced and time consuming method of making the arrows identifiable in groups is a process called “cresting.” Cresting arrows involves creating bands of colours around the arrow shaft. Using unique patterns of colours makes the arrows different enough to be told apart from one another. 9.4.4. Arrow Length: Please refer to section \n  4.2.4.2. “Determining draw and arrow length” for a description of how to ensure that arrows are a safe length for each archer. Arrows are usually left uncut for safe usage by novices having varying draw lengths. An uncut arrow will often be 29 inches or more. While not optimal for performance, an archer can always safely shoot an arrow that is longer than his or her draw length. Also in this way a stiffer spined (*), and therefore more robust, arrow may be used to give a longer life span. \n(*) See the following section for the definition of spine For taller archers needing longer arrows, carbon arrows should be considered since long aluminium arrows are too stiff for light draw weight bows. The lightest available spine for a 32” draw length, for example, is a 1916. Such a stiff arrow would not fly well out of a bow with a light enough draw weight for novices. 9.4.5. Arrow Spine and Size: Arrow shafts have different spines. The spine is a characteristic close to flexibility. There are two standards to measure the spine of an arrow. The ATA (Archery Trade Association) Standard: When measuring arrow spine rating an arrow of 29 inches is used, this is place on two points 28 inches apart and a weight of 880 grams (1.94 lbs.) is hung in the middle. A dial gauge measures the movement from the home position of the arrow to the position now reached with the weight suspended. This measurement is calculated in 1,000ths of an inch to give the static spine rating of this particular arrow. I.e. an arrow that deflects a ½ inch (0.5 of an inch) will have a static spine rating of 500 and an arrow that deflects ¾ inch (0.75 of an inch) will have a static spine rating of 750. \n \n120 deg. 120 deg. \n120 deg. \nThe correct measured arrow length is from the bottom of the slot in the nock to the end of the shaft. \n \nThe dial hand set to zero. \n An arrow standing on two points 28 inches apart."}

The spining method as used by an Asian arrow making company: An arrow manufacturing company in Asia uses metric measurements, and as such the numbers written on their arrows do not correspond to the ATA system, so care must be taken to ensure you are selecting the right arrows when making a purchase from companies that do not use the ATA system to spine their arrows. \n \n For this Asian company’s the spine is determined by the weight required to deflect the shaft by 2cm with the shaft supported at points 500mm apart. The arrow is then given an identification to suit this finding. See table below. \n \nA carbon arrow with an ATA spine around 1200 fits many beginners (if it is long enough), while a 1716 is recommended as the usual aluminium arrow for novices. The numbers used to differentiate aluminium arrows are often different from the spine value of the arrow. They are useful, however, in indicating the relative stiffness and strength of the shafts in question. The arrow shown below using the ATA standard is a 1716. The tube diameter is 17/64ths of an inch with a wall thickness of 16 thousandths of an inch, e.g.1716. Be aware that the aluminium arrow is stiffer, heavier and slower. Also, whereas it is considered as more forgiving than the carbon shafts, it can take a permanent bend. 1716s can be loosed with reasonably straight flight with the lower weight bows used if left at the full uncut length of about 29˝. The more suitable 1616 will be quite fragile for general beginner use. 9.4.6. Arrow assembly & maintenance 9.4.6.1. Fitting the nock: It is recommended that arrows be bought full-length. The shop will install the nocks if asked but you can fit them yourself if you wish to do so. Put a small amount of fletching glue on the swaged end of the arrow then fit an appropriate sized nock, twisting it a little to spread the glue around the swaging. \nShaft number Outside diameter (mm) Weight for spine (kg) \nStraightness per inch Weight Grains/inch Shaft length (inch) \n1100 4.44 1.9 ± 0.001 5.82 28.0 1000 4.52 2.1 ± 0.001 6.14 29.0 900 4.76 2.4 ± 0.001 6.36 29.5 800 4.79 2.5 ± 0.001 6.56 30.0 700 5.25 3.0 ± 0.001 6.80 31.0 600 5.32 3.2 ± 0.001 7.14 32.5 500 5.38 3.6 ± 0.001 7.49 33.0 400 5.54 3.8 ± 0.001 7.88 33.5 300 5.65 4.7 ± 0.001 9.03 34.0 \nweight \nTube diameter, e.g. 17 thousandths of an inch \nCross-section through arrow \nWall thickness e.g. 16 thousandths of an inch \n2cm \nKen Bearman"}

Installing the point into an arrow: The next task is to fit the point. The shop will install the piles if asked but you can install them yourself if you wish to do so. \n \n To do this you will need a small flame and some “warm melt” glue. \n Warm the point of the arrow in the flame whilst holding the point with the fingers; only minimal heat is required. If the point is too hot to hold by hand, the heat may damage the front of the arrow when the point is inserted. \n Rub some of the warm melt glue around the insert part of the pile and put a small ring of glue in the end of the arrow. Insert the pile into the end of the arrow with a slight twisting action until the shoulder on the pile fits up against the end of the arrow. \n Should it be necessary to remove a pile, heat the point of the pile, not the arrow shaft. Then hold the pile in a pair of pliers and remove with a slight twisting action."}

Versions of these jigs are pictured below. \n To fletch an arrow, first put it into the fletching jig, making sure that the nock is well seated. Secondly, place the chosen fletching in the clamp. Most fletching clamps have some mark like a cut-out for lining up the back of the fletching. Clean the gluing edge with a clean cloth dampened with acetone. Put a thin layer of glue along this edge and put the clamp in the fletching jig with the glued edge of the fletching pressing against the arrow. \n Wait the recommended time for the glue to dry enough to hold the fletch in place. When the glue is set, remove the clamp and turn the dial at the nock end of the jig to another position (120 degrees) and repeat the process until all fletchings have been glued to the arrow. Make sure while fletching that the cock fletch is properly aligned with the nock. Most fletching jigs have an indicator to show where this alignment occurs."}

Having a fletching jig such as this greatly reduces the time required to fletch a set of arrows. When all three fletching have been fitted put a little bead of glue to the front and rear of each fletching where they meet the arrow shaft. This helps reduce the chance of the fletchings coming off should they miss the target and land in the grass. \n \n \n9.4.6.4. Checking the straightness of the arrow: To check the straightness of the arrow, the suspect arrow can be laid and spun on another arrow. If the arrow is bent it will wobble and possibly make a vibrating noise. \n If the arrow is bent, an arrow straightener will enable aluminium arrows to be straightened. There are several models of arrow straightener available commercially. Do not try to straighten carbon arrows as these will break and may cause injury if care is not taken. \n If a carbon arrow is suspected of being damaged the following steps may help. Take hold of both ends of the arrow, twisting one end one way and the other end in the opposite direction. Then reverse the twisting action. If there is some damage you should be able to hear the carbon fibres rubbing on each other as the arrow twists. If this sound is heard discard the arrow as they are not repairable. Be careful when conducting this test. In fact it is advisable to wear good strong gloves and protective eye shields."}

Reminder: A minimum of six arrows per novice are recommended 9.5. TAB Using a finger tab is the most popular way to protect the string fingers from the friction of the string. There are many types of tab on the market and as the novice develops they will try many and then settle on one that suits them. \n Differing types of finger tabs. Many archery coaches do not introduce any finger protection right away in order to be able to check the proper string grip of the novice. When it is introduced, explain that the tab protects the fingers from any possible soreness or abrasions that the string may cause if one is not used. Also it allows for a smoother release of the string which produces better arrow flight and better arrow grouping. Most beginners will start with a basic tab made from one or two pieces of leather and then may progress to a shelf tab with a finger spacer and possibly even a palm plate and/or fourth finger rest. \n 9.6. ARMGUARD (bracer) An armguard is an essential part of a novice’s kit and is mandatory for the first shots in order to minimize the risk of pain or injury to the novice. Show the class an armguard and how they are fitted.

WRIST/FINGER SLING A sling helps the archer to keep a relaxed bow hand and avoid the bow from falling to the ground upon release. There are two popular types of slings on the market. A “wrist sling” is attached to the archer’s wrist, while a “finger sling” (the most popular type) usually fits between the forefinger and thumb. A sling mounted on the riser is not recommended. \n Wrist sling Finger sling \n The hybrid Wrist-Finger sling is also an alternative It is advisable to wait for the second lesson before introducing a bow or finger sling to the novices. If they are introduced to a wrist sling or finger sling on the first lesson it may confuse them with all the other things they have to remember. The wrist sling or finger sling should be loose enough to allow the bow free movement when the shot is made but not so loose that the bow slips out of the hand. \n With a sling that is too long the novice tends to close the hand upon the release to avoid the bow slipping down between the string and the bow-hand. 9.8. QUIVER It is advisable for novices to use a quiver so that the arrows are in a safe place prior to shooting them. There are many types of quiver available, including belt quivers (shown in the next illustration), back quivers that hold the arrows above the archer’s head or shoulders, bow quivers that are attached to the riser, pocket quivers that fit in a hip pocket and ground quivers that rest on the floor. As the novices develop, they will select the one that best suits their needs. Two types of quivers are suitable for group instruction: the belt or side quiver, and the ground quiver. Beginners with belt quivers quite often jab other archers with nocks because a beginner isn’t accustomed to having sharp sticks swinging off their bodies. Depending on what the novice is wearing, a quiver-specific belt maybe required. Basic belt quivers can be made to act as either left or right-hand by reversing the hook. They are suitable for indoor and outdoor shooting. This type of quiver avoids the beginners coming back from targets with arrows in their hands; a significant safety benefit. Ground quivers come in two different types, indoor and outdoor. The indoor types have a flat base that does not mark the floor and is heavy enough to support the arrows upright. The outdoor type has a metal spike on the bottom so it can be driven into the ground to prevent the wind from tipping it over. Some ground quivers also serve as bow supports and have two curved prongs at the top to rest the bow. Floor quivers should be placed on the shooting line about 30 cm in front of the archer. There are five disadvantages to using a ground quiver:"}

On another hand the ground quiver allows the archer to more easily know where to stand while shooting. It helps them to line up with the target butt they are supposed to be shooting at. In addition, they’re simple to use and to make (no need for belts or clips). \n 9.9. CHEST-GUARD When taking part in archery training sessions the archers should wear clothes that are reasonably close-fitting around the upper body and arms, though not so tight as to restrict movement. If the clothing is too loose or baggy in these areas the bowstring may snag on the clothing when the bow is shot, making the arrow deviate from its true line of direction. The following illustrations show a chest guard in use and a piece of material wrapped around a baggy sleeve. Safety pins or some tape can also be used to keep loose clothing from the path of the bowstring. \n A chest guard \n A simple loop of soft elastic wrapped around the arms \n A band of tape keeping a loose sleeve out of the path of the string 9.10. FOOTWEAR The sport of archery requires the novice to be on his or her feet for long stretches at a time. Consequently, footwear that both promotes a stable stance and comfort during walking is ideal. An average athletic shoe works very well. While it is possible to shoot in most any footwear, it is essential that open toed shoes are not worn on the archery field. The archer \nQuiver"}

TARGET BUTT A target butt or butts will be required; the usual height of the centre point is 130 cm +/- 5 cm from the ground. It may be advisable to have the butt lower than this for the first lesson so that any arrows that miss the target do not travel too far. For the first lesson do not use a target face as the beginners need to concentrate on their form rather than their score. \n For entry level, the centre of the target butt is often set lower than the official measurement for tournaments Use a soft material for the target mat in order to avoid the arrows bouncing back on the beginners shooting from a short distance. For further information on target mats and stand, see pages 10 and 11 of the document entitled “How to make an Archery Range” at http://www.worldarchery.org/Portals/1/Documents/Development/Documents/How_to_make_an_Archery_Range.pdf 9.12. BOWSTRING 9.12.1. String description: A bowstring is the element connecting both extremities of the Recurve and Long bow. The arrow is nocked near its middle and the archer pulls it back then releases it. A bowstring is made by a thread twisted up several times on its length, and strengthened by servings from another strand in the potential wear points. \n There are many materials for bow strings on the market but Dacron is the preferred material for beginner’s bows. To ensure that the proper amount of energy is transferred to the arrow, 8 strands of Dacron is ideal, but up to 10 strands may be used. Beware when choosing a different string material as some manufacturers do not guarantee their “beginner bows” if some of these “non-stretch” materials are used. 9.12.2. Making a string: Whatever material is being used, the basic method to make a string remains the same. Care should be taken to have the number of strands suitable for the material being used as some materials are thicker or thinner than others. The materials and tools needed to make a string are: • a spool of Dacron (or other material) • serving material (usually soft twist or braided nylon) • string server • scissors • 2 markers (each a different colour) • a ruler AND • patience • time • care • the will to make a good string, even if it means starting all over again. Installation onto the support device: If you already have a bowstring that is the length of the new one you are about to make it is easier to make the new one the correct length on the first try. If you do not already have a string which is of the correct length there are procedures and measurements which will to help get close to"}

This will be discussed a little later. If you have a string that is the correct length: Turn the string jig post carrier ends so that they are in line. This part depends on the length of the string, but undo between 10 and 15 of the twists. Place it on, and adjust the string jig so that there is no sag on the string. Do not have the string too tight as this will have an effect on the string length that is being made. Take the old string off the jig. \n If you do not have a string that is the correct length: Set the distance between the outside parts of the two external posts of the string jig to a length that is 3½ inches (9 cm) shorter than the length of the bow. This measurement depends on the make of the bow but it will bring you close to the required length for subsequent string making. Winding the new string material: Turn the jig ends so they are square to the line of the jig. Loosely tie one end of the string material to a string post about 2 centimetres below the groove on the post which takes the string material. Then wind the string material around the posts, keeping to the groove at the top of each post. Make sure the rotation starts by going around the post that is the nearest to the post the string material is tied to. The secret to a good, reliable string lies in the equal tension of each strand. If the tension is not equal between all strands, the string performs poorly or may even break because the pressure is held only by a few strands. As the pressure of beginner bows is always less than 25 lbs, we recommend making strings using Dacron with 8 strands. If you are making an 8 strand string wind around the jig 4 times. For a 10 strand string, wind around the jig 5 times. Always make sure the finishing end is tied lightly to the post that is past the post to which the start of the string material was tied. This allows an overlap of the \nstring material to be secured under the loop serving. \n Making the first string end: Make the first end of the string to be served the end of the jig that has the string material overlap. This will be beneficial and stop those ends coming loose as the string manufacture continues. Untie the starting end that was tied 2 centimetres down the first post and loop it round the post groove under the windings of the first string post. Starting serving the loop: Pass the end of the serving thread through the strands of the strand that are wound around the posts and, while holding the end of the serving thread along the string strands, serve over it for approximately 1cm. At this point cut off the excess loose serving thread and continue serving until you reach the required length that suits your limb width. All servings must be wound on the string in the same direction to ensure that they will not come loose when twists are added to the string for active use. One possible system is to always serve from right to left, having the serving tool come forwards under the string. If all servings are completed this way they will all be in the same direction. \nStart Finish"}

On most of the entry-level bows, 6 centimetres is correct for the loop on the lower limb and 8 centimetres for the upper limb. It can vary depending on the width and thickness of the limbs. Mark the end of the selected length. \n The length of the serving for the loop depends on the size of the limb tip Creating and finishing the loop: When the correct length of serving has been reached, untie the two ends of the wound string material, then turn the string jig posts 90 degrees. Slide the string around the jig so that the served section is now around the outside post. \nWhen the correct length of serving has been reached, turn the string jig posts and continue to serve Line up the two ends of the serving rather than having one overlap the other. This provides for a thinner junction area of the string, which will fit nicely into the string groove in the centre of the limb ends. Continue serving the now-joined loop in the same direction as before. Make sure the two loose ends of the string material are held along this section and served over*. After about 6 centimetres the two loose ends should be cut off, making sure that there are at least 4 winds of serving between cutting off the first loose end and the second. This prevents the formation of a small step along the serving, which may wear and cause the serving to break during use. (*) Because strings for entry-level bows are thin, in order to get a little more thickness under the centre serving and have a better nock pinch, you can attach the loose ends at opposite ends of the jig and have the two loose ends under the centre serving, instead of in one loop. Serving to the correct length: Wind the serving on to within 1 centimetre of the desired length i.e. about 10 or 12 centimetres. The exact measurement depends on the limb Recurve curvature, but it is necessary to have approximately 1cm of serving not touching the limb when the bow is at rest. Mark the end of the selected length. Keeping the tension on the serving, pull the serving tool away from the string and cut the serving thread leaving about a 40-centimetre length for finishing off the serving. If you do not cut it, just make bigger the loop/bridge described below, in order to pass the serving tool below."}

Then wind the tail backwards around the string under the bridge and towards the loop end of the string. \n End preparation by making a loop or bridge Serving back through the loop or bridge: Continue winding the tail around the string in the same direction passing the tail end of the serving over the top of the string with the left hand to the thumb and forefinger of the right hand, bringing it through the loop/bridge and passing it back to the left hand. This part of serving will be running through the loop/bridge and toward the serving already done with the serving tool.

The loop serving must be centred between the two posts to ensure that when the loop is being formed there is no (or a very small) overlap of the ends of the serving to ensure there are no bare string fibres showing. Bear in mind that the top loop of the string must be large enough to slip over the top limb when stringing the bow. Twisting the string in the correct direction: When both end loops are completed, the string should be fitted to the bow so that the centre serving can be added. (It is also possible to do the centre serving on the string jig). To do this fit the top loop over the top limb and slide it down about 10 centimetres. Take hold of the loop for the lower limb and twist it for 10 to 20 turns (see next section entitled “Getting the correct Bracing Height)."}

If the string is twisted in the opposite direction to the serving, the serving will possibly come loose and may move during use. All three servings must be wound on the string in the same direction. Some people serve their strings in a different direction than shown in this document. The following diagrams may help in determining the direction the string should be twisted in relation to the serving to stop any of the servings coming loose during use. \n \nThe string shown on the right is not correct as the string has been twisted in the opposite direction to the servings. Getting the correct bracing height: The Brace Height is the distance between the deepest part of the bow grip and the string. \n Brace height measurement If the new string is not the correct length for a given bracing height then the length may be adjusted by adding or reducing the number of twists in the string. Bow Height Acceptable range Average brace height 64 inches 19,7 -22,9 cm 21,5 cm 66 inches 20,3 – 23,5cm 22 cm 68 inches 21 – 24,1cm 22,5 cm 70 inches 21,6 – 24,8cm 23 cm The minimum recommended is approximately 1 full turn every 7.5 centimetres or 3 inches. While there is no maximum number of turns, remember that, the more twists in the string the longer it will take to settle to its working length. More twists also means more “springiness” in the string, resulting in decreased speed. Bedding in the wax: Before bedding in the wax have the brace height 3 millimetres higher than the desired final height. The bedding process increases the string’s length, thus lowering the brace height. Take a piece of leather, or a Dacron strand that is also waxed and fold it around the string. Rub up and down the full length of the string to generate heat and melt the wax, bedding it into the string. Be careful not to heat the string up too much or you may damage the strands.

Choose a serving material with a diameter to give the correct fit for the size of nocks to be used. Mark and start the serving 4 – 5 cm above the desired nocking point position to give adequate string protection. Set the bow with the top limb on the right and remember to serve in the same direction that the end loops were served, i.e. from right to left taking the serving spool over the top of the string and away from you. \nJust after the tail has come out at the start of the center check the nock fit on the serving. This will save having to build up the nocking area to get a good fitting nock or having to replace the serving because the nock is too loose or tight. See the section “Nock fit tips” further down. If it is a little too loose, try the nock fit on the part of the serving with the tail underneath. If that fits, simply serve over the tail. If it is still too loose, remove the serving and choose a bigger serving strand or add the required number of Dacron strands where the nock will go. If the serving is slightly too thick (which is unlikely with only 8 or 10 strands), try increasing the tension on the server. Otherwise, stop, remove the serving and choose a thinner serving strand. \n Locate where the string serving will be and fix the start end of the serving material Serving the required length. Mark the end of the selected length.

When the serving is 8 to 10 millimetres short of the required length, pull the required length of serving off the spool to make a loop or bridge and pass the serving device underneath. Reduce the tension of the server before unrolling the end strand. This allows it to detach easily. Make sure that there is one “foot” of the bridge on each side of the string body. Serve back toward the serving through the loop just made. This serving does not need to be tight but the spool must be turned around the string in the same direction as the serving was applied. Make sure that the loop is always kept tight otherwise the serving on the right of the loop will come loose, which will cause a problem when the string is in use. When this reverse serving is about 8 to 10 millimetres long, about 12 turns, bring the serving on the serving spool out and trap it under the right hand side of the loop.

Check in which direction the limb has to be straightened out. Then take it down. 2. Dip a long length of the limb in hot water for at least 5 minutes. 3. With a pair of gloves or pieces of rag, take it out of the water and counter twist it. 4. Hold the counter twist under a cold water tap for at least 30 seconds. 5. Wipe with a rag during the final cooling 6. Put back the limb in place on the riser. 7. Put the string on and redo the control. You will likely have to redo the above process a few times before getting the limb straight. 9.13.2.4. Vertical string resistance If you are undecided between some different models of bows that are similar in height and weight, you can make your choice using the following comparison. \n Block the riser, and move the string up and down. The model showing the best vertical resistance should have your preference. It will allow better vertical groups from the novice, by being more forgiving with the little changes of pressure at the bow hand and string grip. 9.13.2.5. Tiller For a bow to be efficient both limbs have to work in unison. Upon the separation of the arrow from the string: • If the top limb is ahead of the bottom one, the arrow exits pointing downward • If the bottom limb is ahead of the top one, the arrow exits pointing upward In both cases, the arrow will “porpoise”. To generate the synchronisation of the two limbs, the makers usually produce the bottom limb a little heavier than the top one. This weight difference distorts the geometry of the bow as reported in the illustration below."}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0277", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 276, "page_start": 277, "page_end": 277, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  277 \n  \n \n The reason for this difference is that the archer applies more pressure to the lower part of the bow, since the bow hand and string grip are below the centre of the bow (particularly with 3 fingers below the arrow). Hence the bottom limb is stressed more than the top one, and has more distance to run back. This is one of the reasons for a high nocking point (to decrease the stress on the bottom limb, and stress a little more the top one). To cover this longer distance, the bottom limb must return faster back to the original position than the top one. The normal difference between the measures of distance (a) and distance (b) is a little less than half a centimetre for a bow used with one finger above and two fingers below the arrow. The first challenge with setting tiller on an entry-level bow, is that it can be used with different string grips (3 fingers at about 4cm below the nock, 3 fingers just below the nock, 1 finger above and 2 fingers below the nock). Due to this difficulty, an “intermediate” tiller that is higher than the manufacturers’ recommendation should be set: the distance (a) about ¾ cm greater than the distance (b). But the second challenge with an entry-level bow is \nthat, usually, you cannot adjust the tiller. Hence just use the original one and set the nocking point (the lower part of the nock) about 1cm above square. Further details on nocking point height are covered in the section 9.11.5. 9.13.3. Selecting and fitting the arrow rest: There are many models of arrow rests available. For entry-level archery, plastic rests work best because they are more forgiving than those with a metal arm on which the arrow rests. \n A popular and satisfactory type of rest To extend the life of such a rest, cut the curve end at the level of the Red line. Hunting-type rests made of dark rubber-like plastic are more resistant, but the arrow usually rubs on these rests and after a while the fletchings become marked or damaged. \n Because most entry-level bows are not fitted with a pressure button, the arrow-rest must have a lateral spacer for the arrow. When the arrow rest is used in association with a pressure button, make sure that the hole in the arrow rest fits exactly over the corresponding hole in the riser during installation. If these two holes are not lined up the arrow rest may foul the pressure button plunger negating the efficiency of the button’s operation. \na>b"}

If you decide to use a flipper-rest or any kind of plastic rest with a straight/horizontal rest surface for the arrow, make sure that the arrow rest arm does not slope down away from the bow. If it does, the arrow may slip down the arm and fall off the rest during the draw. The arrow rest arm should be sloping slightly in toward the bow. This will help keep the arrow up against the pressure button or riser during the draw. 9.13.4. Pressure button: A pressure button, sometimes called a “plunger button,” fits into the riser allowing the arrow to rest against the small end, which acts like a shock absorber for the arrow. If the riser has the facility to fit a pressure button, install one as it could allow for better arrow flight. \n Refer to the WA level 2 coaching manual to set it properly. On an entry level bow, strive to set up the button as follows: • The pressure should be in the middle range of the stiffness of the inner spring • The tip of the button should be such that the arrow shaft is in the centre of the bow. On an entry-level bow, the end of the shaft close to the point, can be very slightly out (left for a R/H archer) \n 9.13.5. Initial nocking point setting: Using a bow square (also called string or bow gauge) clipped to the string and lightly resting on the arrow rest, the lower part of the nock should be above square with the rest arm: • Approximately 10 mm higher if the bow will be used unsighted, with the archer’s three fingers about 4 cm below the nock. • 5 to 6 mm high if the string will be drawn with one finger above the nock and two fingers below the nock. If the bow is to be used with various students using both string grips, it is better to use the higher 10mm nocking point position, or maybe an average measure of 8mm on the string. With this setting, the back of the arrow will pass above the arrow-rest, reducing the risk of the fletchings hitting it and causing the arrow to have an inconsistent flight. \nShaft Button \nAlign the hole in the arrow rest with the pressure button fixing hole. \nNO No YES"}

Arrow selection In section 9.3. several suggestions have been made regarding the selection of the arrow material, spine, length and nock. Now some words about the fletching. Larger fletchings may cause some problems in getting them to clear the arrow shelf or the vertical part of the riser during the initial stages of the arrow flight. On the other hand, smaller fletchings may not give sufficient stability to the arrow during its flight. \n It is better to use standard sizes: • Length (2 ¾ ”), or a little longer (up to 3”) • Height 1/2” Note: Big and colourful fletching make finding arrows a lot easier when they miss the target and are in the grass! 9.13.7.

Clicker: A clicker is a draw length check for the archer, when the novice has good form and their draw length is consistent the coach may invite them to fit a clicker to their bow. The clicker is a tool that helps the archer expand the upper torso at full draw and, hopefully, release during this expansion. \n Using a fully adjustable clicker makes it easier to accommodate any draw length change that the novice may encounter as they develop. \n The extended clicker on the left is fitted under the sight base, while the one on the right is set on the sight bar; hence it is more for level 2. \nClicker (draw length check) \nUp to 1 cm"}

Introduction Archery, as a recreational and competitive activity, offers an excellent opportunity for the physically challenged and able-bodied to participate on an equal basis. Thus, every effort should be made to accommodate people with disabilities who are interested in trying or competing in archery. To that end, coaches need to be prepared to adapt equipment in order to best suit the needs of every archer. With little or no alteration to the equipment, effective shooting can be experienced by those with physical limits in their lower limbs and, with the arrival of compound bows, those with physical limits in upper body function may enjoy the sport. People with other kinds of disability, such as visual or hearing impairment, can also enjoy archery using adapted equipment. There is a wide variety of specialized gear available to assist the physically challenged archer. Spend some time and talk to the novice about their disability (it is also important to find out what the person can do and/or their disabilities) in order to find out as much as you can about the individual's situation. They are the best person to inform you about any limitations they may have which may affect the way in which you teach or coach them. It may be, for example, that a particular condition means that the person will tire very quickly and lessons should be shorter than normal. If the novice’s disability includes some difficulty in communicating, there must be someone who can interpret or help with communication. If you are concerned about any medical issues, then you should consult someone in the medical profession. You may find that you have to adjust either the archery technique or equipment to suit the particular person that you are coaching. People take up archery for many different reasons and it is useful to find out, at an early stage, what the novice wants from the sport. They may just want to have fun and enjoy shooting. However, if they have aspirations to become an elite athlete and be selected to represent their country at international disabled events such as the Paralympic Games, then the coach needs to be aware of the rules which govern these events. \n10.2. Types of disability There are many people with different disabilities in the world and nearly all of them are able to do archery. These disabilities can be broken down into four main categories: • Physical disabilities • Sensory disabilities • Mental disabilities • Various illnesses Within each of these categories, there will be a wide range of different limiting factors. The coach will not necessarily have to know about all these disabilities but will find it easier to look at the way an archer shoots. The following categories can be used to help simplify coaching athletes with a disability: • Archers with limited or no use of arms • Standing archers with some balance problems • Archers with a visual impairment • Archers with mental disabilities • Archers shooting from a wheelchair • Archers shooting from an ordinary chair or stool • Archers with communication difficulties • Archers with a combination of difficulties 10.3. Archers with limited use of arms 10.3.1. Bow arm 10.3.1.1. Prosthesis If the bow arm is amputated, the archer can be fitted with a prosthesis that has a device to hold the bow. They may well have one which is used for normal everyday tasks and which can be adapted for this purpose."}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0282", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 281, "page_start": 282, "page_end": 282, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  282 \n  \n A bow arm prosthesis strapped to the bow. 10.3.1.2. Strapping If the bow arm is very weak or the novice has no grip in their fingers, the bow can be strapped to the hand. This strapping has to be very tight in order to keep the bow in the correct position but should be checked frequently to make sure that it is not cutting off the blood supply to the fingers. \n Making use of strapping to hold the bow 10.3.1.3. Elbow Splint \n   If the bow arm is too weak to hold the weight of a bow with the arm held out towards the target, an elbow splint can be used. \n An elbow splint supporting the bow arm 10.3.2. Drawing arm 10.3.2.1. Prosthesis If the drawing hand, wrist or a part of the forearm is missing, a prosthesis can be fitted as in 10.3.1.1. This can have a hook fitted which hitches to the string. The novice twists the forearm in order to release the hook from the string. With a Compound bow, the system illustrated below is an option. \n Trigger activated by the opening of the angle of the elbow join There are two popular alternatives in case of a more severe amputation. A release aid attached to a body harness and activated either by the rotation of the top body, or by a pressure of the jaw on the trigger."}
{"id": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1-0283", "source": "MANUAL_COACHING_LEVEL_1.pdf", "chunk_index": 282, "page_start": 283, "page_end": 283, "text": "COACHING MANUAL \n  283 \n  \n Trigger activated by the change of the orientation of the top body Alternatively, the novice can draw the bow with their teeth. A number of archers do this. A piece of leather is attached to the string on either side of the nocking point. The archer holds this with the teeth to draw the string and opens their mouth in order to loose the arrow. This \"mouthtab\" needs to be checked frequently as the archer will bite through it eventually. \n An archer pulling the string with his mouth. 10.3.2.2. Release aid If the drawing arm is weak and there is no grip in the fingers, the method used for many years and still useful for novices is to strap a hook to the hand. The novice hooks this on the string to draw, releasing with a twisting motion. Many archers prefer to use this kind of release aid as it is quite simple to make and easy to use. If the archer does not have sufficient dexterity in the fingers to release in the usual way, a release aid with a trigger can be adapted so that it activates when the trigger is brought into contact with something, e.g. a particular part of the jaw. \nAn archer using a release aid with a cheek trigger 10.3.2.3. Dexterity In determining the shooting side of an athlete with a disability, consideration for the specific limitations of the archer is the first priority. Depending on how an archer’s strength and control are affected by their disabilities, they may shoot better with one hand than the other, regardless of which eye is dominant. Therefore in order to help the archer shoot from a position where they have the ability to execute a good shot, eye dominance may have to be disregarded. 10.4. Standing archers with balance problems Balance problems for a standing archer can have a number of causes such as one leg longer than the other, polio, one artificial leg, etc. There are a number of solutions to this. The archer may well have a shoe which is built up to compensate for a disparity in leg length. If not, the coach can suggest putting a block of wood, for example, under the shorter leg to create a good, upright stance. If the archer's balance is very poor, which could be a safety issue if they were to fall over when it was windy, it is worth suggesting that they shoot from a chair or stool placed on the shooting line."}

Archers with a visual impairment As with all the other categories, this covers a wide range of people. Some will have sufficient vision to shoot in the same way as able-bodied archers while others will have no vision at all. This section is primarily concerned with novices closer to the latter end of the spectrum. Talk to them to find out if they were blind from birth or lost their sight at a later date as this will make a difference to the way they perceive the world. Someone who has been visually impaired from birth may not know what \"red\" is, for example. Allow the novice to feel all the equipment so that they can paint a mental picture of it. As safety is paramount for everyone on the range, there must always be a coach or helper for each blind athlete who is shooting. Very often, initial shots can be made using a \"hands on\" approach, with the permission of the archer. Physically guide them through the steps of shooting an arrow; draw with them, release with them, and guide the bow hand. Let them get the feel of shooting. It has often been asked what pleasure is gained in archery for a blind person to such a visual sport. In fact, the archer will develop the ability to know how accurate the shot is from the sound of the arrow’s impact. The arrow makes a different noise when hitting the gold rather than the white. \n10.5.1. Position on line. In order to have a consistent stance on the shooting line, visually impaired archers need something which they can feel with their feet. A pair of horseshoes attached to the ground (with target pins outdoors or with tape indoors) will enable them to place their feet inside them and be in the same position whenever they return to the shooting line. \n A feet location device to help visually impaired archers feel their shooting location 10.5.2. Sighting The most popular sighting method for beginners to have them use a tactile sight. There are other systems, such as the IRIS system that involves transmitters and an earpiece, but they are generally not appropriate for beginners due to cost, inconvenience and potential interference with the archer’s balance. 10.5.2.1. Tactile sights A very basic tactile sight can be as simple as a camera tripod with the adjustable handle in a position to press on the back of the knuckles. A plastic container filled with water hung from the lower cross strut of the tripod gives it enough stability to resist moving or falling when the archer presses against it. With a little creativity, the precision of this arrangement can be improved, but the contact on the back of the bow hand is the important thing."}

It is important to remember when adjusting the sighting aid that it is moved away from where the arrow has gone, towards the target point, rather than \"following the arrow\" as with a visual front sight. More sophisticated tactile sights are available and additional advice can be sought from the International Blind Sports Association (IBSA). \n A specialised tactile sight that can be finely adjusted using a “click action” adjustment mechanism \n10.5.3. Assistance All visually impaired archers, when using tactile sights, will require an assistant to tell them where their arrows are going so that sight adjustments can be made. After the end is shot, the assistant will guide the archer back to the waiting area before scoring and collecting the arrows. The assistant can only adjust the sight in between shooting ends; if the sight needs adjusting during the shooting end the archers have to change it on their own. \n Assistant adjusting a sight in between shooting ends 10.5.4. Scoring Because the archer still needs to have a sense of where there arrows have gone, he can be accompanied to the target, of course paying attention to the possible dangers that may be found on a shooting range. In the case that the archer cannot walk to the targets, the scorer can push round-head pins into a circular piece of foam to represent the positions where the arrows have struck the butt. The archer can then feel where the arrows have gone."}

The spotting target can be flat or made using pieces of foam built up so it is easy to tell the difference in the rings. \n10.6. Archers with mental disabilities Owing to the diverse nature of mental disabilities, each prospective archer must be assessed individually basis to determine the best course of action. Each mentally challenged archer will most likely require individual attention 100% of the time. If there is only one coach in the club, the archer's parent or another volunteer may be trained as an assistant to look after this individual. Helper or not, the mentally challenged archer must follow directions. If no helper is available, see if the archer can return at another time when they can receive the attention they require. Even if there is no helper, if an archer can behave, they can participate, but safety must always come first. These archers may have physical disabilities as well which can be addressed in the usual way but they are also likely to: • Have a short attention span • Become easily frustrated • Show extreme emotions Tremendous patience is required as instructions may have to be repeated many times. The archer is also likely to: • Turn around suddenly at full draw • Run up to the target before the signal for arrow retrieval has been given In extreme cases, it may be necessary to decide that safety considerations preclude the person from taking part. \n10.7. Archers Using Wheelchairs 10.7.1. Chair position The wheelchair should be placed so that the archer's shoulders are in the same orientation towards the target as for a standing archer. Just as a standing archer's feet position can be at 90 degrees to the target or angled towards the target, so the chair can be at 90 degrees to the target or be angled towards the target if the coach feels that this is beneficial. Make sure that the archer applies the wheelchair brakes while they are on the shooting line. Outdoors, where the ground may be uneven, try to ensure that the archer has all four wheels in contact with the ground so that the chair is stable. Extra room must be allocated to a wheelchair archer on the shooting line. \n Extra space on the shooting line to accommodate a wheelchair 10.7.2. Archer’s sitting position Sitting balance varies considerably with wheelchair users. Those with very poor balance will benefit from a chest or lap strap to gain the extra support required for drawing the bow. Even those with better balance may wish to use a body strap initially until they have gained sufficient confidence for the coach to remove it."}

Those subject to severe spasms in the legs may wish to have their legs strapped. The chair back should be below the shoulder blades in order that the muscles used to draw the bow are not restricted. In order to obtain optimal results, the archers must position themselves exactly the same in the chair for each shot. The coach can assist the archers to find some points of reference and teach them to check their position often against those references. \n Coaches must assist the archers to find some points of reference on the chair. The archers will have a tendency to lean back away from the target to compensate for a lack of balance as they draw the bow, particularly as they tire. This form error may also cause problems with string clearance at the chest and the wheelchair. To counter this issue, archer can lean on the chair back for more stability. \n 10.7.3. Equipment If the archer has no disability in the upper body, the only equipment change that may be necessary is a shorter bow than usual because they are closer to the ground. The archer can place a small pad of foam or rubber just in front of the wheel closest to the target so they can set the bottom limb tip down between shots and rest their bow arm. \n Bow rest With a stabilizer, when the bow tips forwards on release, it will tend to hit the wheel of the chair. Some form of padding added to the wheel will help to prevent damage. \n Padded wheel"}

Stringing the bow Many archers using wheelchairs string their own bows. This is usually done by putting the stringer on the bow and then looping it round the back of the chair. The archer can then push forward on the bow riser in order to tension it and put on the string. \n Bracing a bow from a wheelchair. 10.7.5. Shooting form In most cases, shooting form is the same as for able-bodied archers but, often, the draw will start higher because of the archer's position. Other form modifications will only be required if the archer has additional difficulties with hands or arms. See section 10.3 10.7.6. String clearance One of the difficulties experienced by archers using wheelchairs, particularly when shooting at the shorter distances, is clearance of the string against parts of the chair which are nearest to the target, in particular, the wheel. String clearance is an issue for the novice and must be considered to ensure no damage is caused to the bow and the arrow flight is not impeded. If the string is impeded by a part of the wheelchair the arrow goes upwards, which is a serious safety concern. \n For beginners, it is important that there is string clearance from the wheelchair or arm-rest. The following alternatives can be tried to help with this. • Remove the arm rest of the chair on the target side. \n In this case, just remove the arm rest. • Remove the hand rim from the wheel on the target side or replace the wheel with one without a hand rim. This spare wheel may be kept especially for archery. • Cant the wheels slightly. Most wheelchair users will know how to do this on their particular chair."}

Make sure they move their whole body and rather than just leaning towards the target. 10.7.7. The chair back The archer with poor balance will need to get some support from the back of the chair. It is better if there is a slight sag in the back of the chair rather than having it very taut. As mentioned above, the height must be sufficient to give the archer support but not so much that it restricts the movement of the shoulder blades. In competition, the archer must not support his or her bow arm on the back or handle of the chair while shooting. 10.7.8. Scoring and collecting Indoors, wheelchair archers will often choose to score and collect the arrows themselves, although they may have difficulty pulling out arrows in the higher part of the target. Outdoors, it is difficult to push chairs across uneven grassy fields so they will need someone to score and collect arrows unless smooth pathways have been constructed. \n Passable pathways on an outdoor archery range At outdoor competitions, often other people on the same target or another volunteer will score and collect for an archer using a wheelchair. 10.7.9. Some points to remember Try to talk to the archer at their eye level, not always standing above them. Discuss changes you wish to make in the chair position and let the archer make them, if possible. Remember that, even in competition, archers with very little manual dexterity (such as tetraplegics) are allowed to have an assistant to nock their arrows and adjust their sights so it is quite permissible for you to do this, if the archer wishes. 10.8. Archers shooting from an ordinary chair or stool While most will require a stick or crutch in order to be able to walk, these archers are likely to have more stability than archers using wheelchairs. Since they have their feet on the ground, they will have a much firmer base. Normally, the archer leaves the chair or stool on the shooting line throughout the session so that they do not have to keep repositioning it. The main purpose of a chair or stool is to give the archer the stability which they lack when standing unaided. The archer should be positioned on the seat to emulate, as far as possible, a standing archer. The height of the chair or stool is usually critical and advice may need to be sought from a physiotherapist to find the optimal position. The archer will be unlikely to require support from a chair back (unlike the wheelchair archer) and can be taught in the same way as an able-bodied archer."}

Archers with communication difficulties While athletes in this category may be able to shoot in exactly the same way as able-bodied archers, the coach will have to modify their methods of teaching in order to be able to communicate effectively. 10.9.1. Archers with hearing impairment Depending on the severity of this condition, various steps can be taken. For example, an archer that can lip read may only need to see the coach’s lips for the majority of the instruction. Alternatively, it may be necessary to write down specific words or instructions, backed up by gestures. It is very important, from the safety point of view, that the archer is able to know when it is safe to shoot and/or collect the arrows. A visual signal may be necessary if the audible signal usually given is not appropriate. 10.9.2. Archers with speech impairment Many of the same principles apply as for the hearing impaired. If the coach has too much difficulty understanding the archer, they may \nhave to bring someone with them who can interpret. 10.10. Archers with a combination of disabilities It is very common for someone to have more than one of the disabilities detailed above. For example, tetraplegics will be confined to a wheelchair and will have impaired use of hands and arms. In these cases, aspects of more than one of the above sections will need to be employed in order for the person to shoot. 10.11. Other medical issues Although not strictly classed as a disability, there are a number of medical conditions which an archer may have which the coach should be aware of. Conditions such as asthma, epilepsy, haemophilia, rheumatism etc. may affect one of your novices. Talk with beginners before the first session to make yourself aware of any such conditions. Consult someone in the medical profession to become aware of the appropriate course of action to take in should something happen, for example, if one of your archers had an epileptic seizure. 10.12. Conclusion Embrace the opportunity, should it arise, to coach archers with a disability. It can be very rewarding for a coach to see the enjoyment that a disabled archer can have in their shooting, particularly if there were some difficult challenges in adapting archery to suit the novice."}

As these terms are not specific to archery, nor are they necessarily relevant to the other chapters in this manual, a glossary has been provided at the end of this chapter as a reference for these particular terms. INTRODUCTION: In this chapter warm-up techniques and exercises to develop an archer’s physical capacities - cardio-vascular, body control, body balance and strength - are discussed. Archers are athletes and, as such, they must train much as any other athlete does. To reach the highest levels of performance, this training must be functionally specific and directly related to their own sport discipline, to its technical aspects, and in particular the biomechanical and metabolic needs which are required by the discipline itself. The objectives determined by the physical preparation must also correspond to the real needs of the novice, taking into consideration factors such as their current fitness level and ability to train. As a general statement, the archer’s requirements can be described as follows: • Good cardiovascular fitness so the archer can train or compete for extended periods without tiring. • Accurate control of the vertical posture from the head to the feet. • Control of the horizontal musculoskeletal components used in the execution of the shot process. • The ability to maintain the proper body alignment: shoulders directly above the hips and feet. (*) • Good flexibility and mobility. • Excellent conditioning of all receptors (sensory perceivers) which allow a high degree of precision and for long periods of time. \n(*) See section entitled “The importance of keeping the shoulders and hips directly above the feet” in chapter “6.11.1 Aiming Complementary Knowledge” A fundamental part of the physical preparation in archery is represented by the three “psychomotor” spheres: motor, emotional and intellectual. Research shows that it is crucial to use a balanced combination of physical and coordination-based training exercises for optimal skill development. The so called conditional physical qualities (strength, resistance and stamina) must support and improve the archer’s efficiency in terms of duration or precision with respect to the technical action. Enormous strength and stamina are not necessarily the main goals in improving the athlete’s conditioning, but this does not mean that general physical fitness should be neglected. In fact, the athlete’s base fitness forms the foundation for the development (sooner or later depending on the methodology) of specific archery skills. Therefore we can define the archer as an organism that self-regulates with continuous adaptation controls. In other words, the archer can modify his or her actions to adapt to any internal or external changes occurring during the shot process. Archery is an activity requiring the ability to perceive and interpret incoming information from multiple sources (physical, emotional, intellectual, meteorological, etc.) and react in a coordinated, considered and timely fashion. The incorporation of the bow complicates the reactions required as the archers must take into account the interactions between themselves and the bow as well as the bow/archer unit as a whole. The ability to react to situations and sensations (sensory or physical) increases as the athlete’s skill level improves. A variety of physical skills and strengths are needed for archery, especially if the training is targeted at young people with"}

In addition, varying and alternating training exercises is important to allow continuous and measurable improvements in conditioning and coordination without the risk of developing one muscular pattern while neglecting others. Equilibrium or balance, another key element in archery, is directly linked to: • The degree of postural control, coming through the whole proprioceptive system (internal stimuli); • The quick and effective (postural) adaptations of the oto-vestibular system (organ in the middle ear that controls body position according to its spatial movements). This organ senses and then signals the changes needed in order to find the proper posture and muscle engagement required to function well in response to varying external situations; • The strength to readjust, in a very short period of time, the body’s status through proper and specific muscular contractions. The exercises that develop the ability to maintain or recover good balance need a high level of focus on the part of the novice while the exercise is in progress. This attention has to be mainly directed to the signals coming from the body itself. Developing good balance is a crucial factor in the general evolution of a novice in a sport requiring precision while executing both physical and technical movements through an action. The proposed exercises for developing, refining and consolidating the ability to maintain and/or recover the equilibrium normally involve all three of the previously listed factors. This means that they are all engaged, simultaneously, to re-create the starting conditions or to achieve the objective of recovering the proper body axis. These exercises are not an exhaustive list, but a selection suggested as a starting point for a good and balanced training program. Also the knowledgeable coach should feel free to adapt and change the exercises to best suit the athletes they’re working with. \nTo the lecturer or reader: If, or when, you have some new and interesting exercises, please send them to the WORLD ARCHERY office for inclusion in these documents."}

WARM-UP The physical activities shown below are presented under two main groups. • General physical exercises using common processes and tools as in other sports; • Specific physical training which involves shooting a bow and arrow. Although entry level archers use light weight bows, it is a good idea for coaches to include a warm-up routine at the beginning of the session. Aside from creating a good habit; the exercises will also prevent injuries. The following is a suggestion of how the level 1 coach can organize a warm-up session, one of many that could be presented. This particular example involves several common warm-up components: • Cardio-vascular exercises; • Movements of general warm-up; • Stretching; • Warm-up through effort producing movements – an introduction to strengthening; • Oriented warm-up, i.e. simulations such as using an elastic resistance band; • Specific warm-up, i.e. shooting arrows. Archers should not put on any part of their equipment, especially their quiver and chest guard (if any), while preparing for warm-up. \n 11.1.1. Cardio-Vascular exercises It is suggested that the warm-up start with the athletes participating in light cardiovascular exercise, such as jogging, jumping jacks or even a brisk walk. \n After a few minutes of light cardio, the warm-up progresses to other exercises, for example: Leg Crossing \n Alternate passing one leg below the other one In addition to being an excellent general warm-up exercise, leg crossing (pictured above) strengthens the core and the pushing muscles."}

Movements of general warm-up Warm-up exercises must to be done prior to stretching exercises in order to loosen up the muscles and ensure good blood flow. 11.1.2.1. Torso warm-up Torso Twisting First step: Let the archer stand on both feet with arms spread to the sides. The torso, pelvis and legs are kept still. The extended arms are balanced from left to right in the horizontal plane at different heights. Hands are kept relaxed and heavy. \n Second step: Pivot the torso and hips in a turning movement. Hands and arms stay balanced at different heights, relaxed and heavy, merely following along with the motion. \n Torso rotation Third step: Keep the torso rotated for several seconds on one side, while turning the head from side to side three times. The head must be in an up-right position. Repeat on the other side. \n Bent Over Trunk Twist Instead of twisting the torso upright, this exercise can be done bent over. Have the novice stand with their arms horizontally extended to the side, and their knees straight but not locked. Start the exercise by bending the trunk forward. With a horizontal torso (bent at the hips) twist so that the left hand reaches for the right foot (and touches it if possible) and then reverse for the right hand to the left foot. The arms stay straight throughout and the hands travel through a long arc from roughly straight up to reaching for the opposite foot. \n This exercise is done alternately to complete a set of 6 to 10 repetitions with smooth transitions with no pause between sides. \n Alternatively, one hand to the opposite foot"}

They then turn their head to the direction of the shoulders, alternating between left shoulder and right, with a brief pause at the starting position. \n Head turn The novice should inhale while turning to one side as far as possible and exhale while turning to the other side. Neck Bending Sideways Instructions: Starting with the novice’s head upright and facing forward, have the archer bend his neck sideways alternating between left and right sides. The idea of the exercise is to bring the ear towards the shoulder on each side. \n Lateral neck bending Lowering the shoulder opposite to the direction of head canting introduces a stretch to the movement, which is the subject of the next exercise. All of the previous three neck exercises help loosen tight muscles around the neck and shoulders. \n11.1.3. Stretching In addition to aerobic and strength capabilities, it is important to consider and to continuously develop the flexibility and the articular ability of the archer. A definition of flexibility and articular ability is: “The absolute range of movement in one articulation or series of articulations achievable during a specific action with the assistance of a partner or a gymnastic apparatus” (Gunnarson 2001). This definition states that flexibility is not something generic but is specific to a defined articulation or series of articulations. In general, people are not naturally flexible to the same degree in all areas of their body. Flexibility or good articulation in a specific area of the body does not necessarily guarantee flexibility elsewhere. Good articulation in the upper body does not always mean good articulation in the lower body There are many quantitative variables that produce some general conclusions about a novice’s likely overall articulation and flexibility. Gender: women are generally 10%-15% more flexible than men. Age: young people have a superior degree of plasticity due to the characteristics of the skeleton and of the tendinous-ligamentous apparatus, along with the internal temperature and the viscosity of the interstitial liquids of the body. For this reason, an adequate warm-up is very useful to obtain the maximum degree of articular mobility by the novices. Obviously, the development of the articular ability must be mainly orientated to the muscular zones that need it to better perform specific sport actions. For instance in archers, it is the pectoral muscle that allows, or limits depending on the stretching capability, the alignment of the shoulders following the extension of the back muscles. This does not mean that the “non-primary’’ zones for specific sport actions should be neglected, but, obviously, the ability to obtain high level performances involves a rather emphatic specificity."}

In opposition to a muscle operating a traction, or producing a stretch, there is one that must (for obvious reasons of equilibrium) release and comply with the mechanical processes occurring in that specific muscular zone. This muscle is called the antagonist and it must be the target of primary focus during the training to increase articular freedom in the area. During an archery practice, the areas where it is necessary to operate with particular care to obtain the maximum of mobility, are: • The neck; • The shoulders; • The entire spine; • The hands and the fingers. And to a lesser degree the hips (for disciplines that encounter uneven footing). Stretching should be done only when well warmed-up, because it is safer to stretch warm muscles than cold muscles. The stretch itself should take place during each exhale in smooth motions, with no jerking or bouncing. The novice should stay relaxed and not force the stretches more than 70 - 80% of what they can do. Have the novice hold the stretch on each exhale for at least 10 seconds for small muscles, 15 seconds for average muscles and 20 seconds for large muscles. An isometric effort (muscular contraction without any movement) before stretching is another good idea. The following is a good group of stretching exercises for novices. \n11.1.3.1. Torso stretch Back Stretch with Enlaced Elbows Place the left elbow inside the right one. The left forearm wraps around the right one to allow the hands to enlace together. \n Enlaced elbows Push the elbows forward, and then lean the top of the body forward.

Warm-up through effort production Introduction to Strengthening Because archery is based on effort production from a stable and strong foundation, it is essential for the coach to make time to suggest ways in which the novices can develop their strength. Due to the limited number of weekly entry level classes available to most archery clubs, the best time is often after the warm-up and before shooting. This section on strengthening contains exercises that can be conveniently integrated into a shooting session. In particular, those that do not require any apparatus, or only require a stretching band - an essential item in archery education. Many entry level coaches also use an elastic resistance band to show novices strengthening exercises they can do between archery classes."}

Directed warm-up with rubber band As noted in the introduction, many exercises with a rubber band or tube can be undertaken during warm-up. Nevertheless in this section, only “directed” exercises are outlined; i.e. situations in which the novices have to implement physical efforts and activities that are similar to the act of shooting, but without a bow. Most archery coaches conduct some shooting simulations with an elastic band or tube before shooting with the bow and arrows. Draw simulation with the Rubber Band around the String Elbow and the Bow Hand Have the novice start with a high pre-draw, and then, letting the elastic band slide through the fingers of the string hand as needed, cycle through the following: a) a draw from the above shoulder level while inhaling; b) a let-down below shoulder level while exhaling; c) a draw from below shoulder level while inhaling; d) a let-down above shoulder level while exhaling; e) Repeat starting at a) for 15 cycles. \n Elastic band around the string elbow \n Oriented warm-up of the string shoulder \nShooting simulation with an elastic band Instructions: Have the novice carry out the shooting process using an elastic band in place of a bow.

Shooting warm-up This is the final warm-up phase and is often implemented using a blank buttress. During this phase review what was taught during the previous practice session. After this review, the coach will either choose to either teach a new skill or to reinforce the previous one. If the decision is made to continue working on a previously learned skill, it is a good idea to incorporate the circuit of cut-out target faces from the Standard Teaching Process in the shooting warm-up. \n11.2. CARDIO-VASCULAR DEVELOPMENT Although archery is known as anaerobic a-lactic activity (i.e. one that does not produce lactic acid), good cardiovascular efficiency provides an excellent foundation to the archer. During competitions and training sessions (except in the case of very specific training situations) the heart rate should never reach particularly high values. If the heart rate does rise significantly, it is most likely due to emotional factors and not the required metabolic effort. An efficient cardiovascular system allows a faster and more effective recovery through the faster elimination of the residues of energy production generated by continuous and repetitive efforts; therefore it delays fatigue. In addition, good circulation enables faster heart rate stabilisation, creating a more consistent and optimal shooting state for the archer. Aerobic activity is anything that elevates the heart rate in a free-breathing environment as for instance running, cycling, fast walking, rowing and sport games such as basketball, football, handball, etc. Furthermore, such an activity is only considered aerobic when the heart rate is between 50 and 80 percent of the participant’s maximum heart rate. Through a simple formula (called the Karvonen formula) it is possible to determine, simply and precisely, the proper heart rate required to attain a specific degree of aerobic benefit. ((HR max – HR at rest) x percent intensity) + HR at rest In the above formula, “HR max” is the participant’s maximal Heart Rate, and “hr at rest” is their heart rate at rest. For example, for a healthy novice who has a maximum heart rate of 180 bpm (beats per minute) and a resting rate of 70 bpm, if he has to work at 60% of his maximal cardiac efficiency the formula becomes: ((180-70) x 0.60) +70= 136 bpm"}

Exercising with too high a heart rate risks injury, delayed recovery and wastes too much energy for the individual’s objectives. Conversely, working in a range that is at too low a level does not produce any kind of cardiovascular adaptation. Ideally the activity selected for the aerobic training portion will be varied regularly, i.e. alternating running sessions with cycling sessions and with other sports. This is especially true if young novices are involved as the variety will help them improve their level of motor coordination. Aerobic training can be done before or after a shooting session. For instance 15 to 20 minutes of running at a pace defined by the Karvonen formula would not cause any trouble to the novices at the beginning of a training session. Better still, a prolonged warm-up benefits all levels of performance by improving flexibility and increasing the body temperature (making muscular contraction easier as well as other positive impacts) in concert with improving cardiac fitness. Alternatively, a physical training session performed at the end of a shooting session yields many advantages with respect to organic and muscular recovery. If the novice already has a good level of physical efficiency, it is possible to start with 10 minutes of running and then increasing the duration to 30-40 minutes over a few sessions. If the novice is not receptive to this increase, or the novice is not trained in the exercise, it is better to start with a fast walking session and progress from there. The novice should not consciously increase their speed; any increase will occur automatically as the cardiovascular system becomes more efficient. As the novice’s fitness improves, their heart rate for the same level of physical exertion and the engagement will drop. Consequently to maintain the pulse at the preselected rate, \nthe novice will automatically increase their pace. The objective is to maintain a constant heart rate at the preselected target during the physical training session. Periodically, have the beginners take their pulse during the exercise session to gauge their intensity level. Typically, the easiest location for taking a pulse is the carotid artery on the side of the neck. Take care not to press too hard on the carotid artery to avoid an inaccurate reading. Count the number of beats for 6 seconds and multiply that number by 10, or count for 10 seconds and multiply by the number of beats by 6 to get the number of times the heart is beating per minute. If the pulses of the beginners are within their target heart rate zone, they are right on track. If not, adjust the exercise workload until they get into their selected range. As soon as clear improvements appear, the novice should increase their intensity level, for example from 60% to 65%. Continue increasing the challenge as appropriate until the novice reaches 80% of their maximum heart rate. Keep in mind that aerobic activities can be performed in “circuits” in alternation with more specific shooting exercises. This kind of training is normally utilized to increase the novice’s overall fitness. An example of a circuit would be 6-arrow ends alternated with 2 or 3 minutes of running for a number of repetitions to challenge the level of the novice. Aerobic activities can be also utilized, again as a circuit, in alternation with strength exercises, and strength training circuits can also be intermixed with shooting."}

BODY BALANCE The ability of a novice to maintain a controlled, stable equilibrium for a long time on the shooting line is often a condition that can make the difference, either positive or negative, in the final result. This is especially true in situations that involve rain, wind, unstable ground surface, etc. Even without any wind, if the novice’s body sways, the visual alignments used for aiming are disturbed. The novice usually reacts to this by moving the bow arm in order to bring the sight (or arrow point depending on the aiming system) back to the centre of the target. In the meantime, the body sways back, making the visual alignment wrong again. So the novice moves to regain their alignment and so on, creating a vicious circle in which more and more tension builds in the novice’s body. By the end of this scenario, even if the novice releases properly, the arrow impact in the target will be away from the centre because the arrow has been propelled from a different “launch pad”. Also, an unstable body generates only a few, very brief, coordination opportunities between the visual references and the novice’s feelings (see Chapter 1). This generally results in a conscious and deliberate release by the novice instead of the smooth, serene release brought about by a perfect follow-through. In archery, a strong body balance is required in order to keep the aiming eye in a stable special position during the shooting sequence, particularly during the force production period at full draw. In this section, two aspects of body balance are covered: • General Body Balance • Shooting Body Balance \n11.3.1. General Body Balance: 11.3.1.1. Body balance exercises on feet without any device: The following generic exercises have to be implemented at least 3 times per week for a minimum of 4 weeks to be effective. The sessions will typically progress as follows: 30 seconds per exercise in the 1st session - 35 seconds in the 2nd session - 40 seconds in the 3rd session - 45 seconds in the 4th session - 50 seconds in the 5th session - 55 seconds in the 6th session - 1 minute for the following sessions.

STRENGTHENING The development of the archer’s strength is a fundamental step of the preparation, both to improve the technical skills, and to guard against injuries caused by the repetitive nature of shooting a bow. Archery is a sport discipline with a very high need of precision and fine motor control (including the ability to use only the muscle groups required for the specific actions, at the moment required, and with the necessary intensity and duration). Additionally, different parts of the shot sequence require distinct types of muscular contraction or release. Therefore, it is important to have a strength program that incorporates a high degree of archery-specific muscular activity. On the other hand, a generic strength program involving the whole body must be pursued as well, tailored to the novice’s ability level, in order to develop the strength required to support the shooting technique. In fact, many technical actions can only be carried out, or improved, if there is a sufficiently high level of other physical qualities relating to the strength of the student. Normally strength is defined as the ability to lift or to move a certain weight. This is called a “concentric contraction” and it is, for example, the strength exerted by the string side during the drawing of the bow. The reverse action, an “eccentric contraction” is identified as the opposition of a force in the direction of the action produced by the force itself. For example, letting down from full draw back to the rest position without shooting. Finally, an “isometric contraction” is identified as the application of a strength action without any kind of resulting movement. For instance, holding the bow out at arm’s length is a case where the shoulder muscle is engaged with a muscular contraction without any perceived or intended movement. There are other aspects of strength training, such as explosive-reactive movements, that are not important to proper archery physical preparation and, therefore, they will not be described or discussed. \n From the time the novice lifts the bow up until after the follow-through, many muscle groups are activated simultaneously or in a rapid sequence using the three types of contractions described above. Performance improvement will come faster using carefully chosen and specific programs comprised of targeted exercises. Bear in mind that, in the majority of situations, muscular intervention is not due to a single muscle, but to a “chain” (a synergistic or consequent action of multiple muscles) often activated with different contraction methodologies. The strength of a muscular chain is limited by its weakest link. A deficit in a single muscle within a particular muscle group will affect the performance of the routine, and consequently reduce the effect of the whole motoric action. Controlled strength is an essential component in executing a successful shooting sequence. However, the use of indiscriminate overloads without following the basic rules of strength development can create unpleasant side effects. For instance, if the load and the number of repetitions are not properly suited to the training objectives, not only will the performed action not get the desired results, but it may cause undesired and sometimes serious damage. A common occurrence is when the athlete performs an excessive number of sets or repetitions. Instead of developing resistance or strength, this produces a muscular hypotrophy (muscle loss or weakening) and/or a loss of articular mobility (flexibility or range of motion). The following are some simple tips to minimize the risk of injuries, aches, inflammation, etc. due to poor handling of the movements or of the load. • The load used must always allow a “clean” execution, i.e. without any loss of control. In short, the novice must be able to demonstrate complete control of the exercise during the whole routine. • The pause between each routine/series must allow sufficient recovery to ensure the next routine/series is not jeopardized. • The working sessions dedicated to strength development must have enough rest time in between for the body to"}

It is better to have fewer repetitions that are technically well done than many repetitions with poor form. • The correct position of the backbone (posture) is the most crucial of the necessary requirements to produce an efficient movement and, therefore, to obtain the desired results. Correct posture creates the optimal conditions for the entire body to work in. • Perform stretching exercises that involve the muscle group being worked before, during, and after the session. • Use a training program where the number of repetitions and the loading intensity are a function of the desired result and the ability level of the novice. It is very difficult, at this level, to describe fully the difference between the development of maximal strength and the development of resistance strength, otherwise known as stamina or endurance. For the purposes of this manual, maximal strength is generally developed with fewer repetitions (reps) of higher relative loads, while resistance strength comes from more repetitions with lighter loads. When starting a strength-training regimen, the aim is primarily to develop coordination in load bearing movements by using light weights or resistance that can be easily handled by the novice. Once that has been achieved, the threshold of the physical exertion can be pushed forward using higher loading resistances or weights. A simple formula is generally used to select the appropriate resistance or load for a student based on their unique ability level. First the student must discover their “one repetition maximal” load (RM). This is the amount of load at which the athlete can perform only one repetition of the exercise due to the high load intensity. \nDevelopment of resistance strength (stamina or endurance): Use a load between 40% and 70% of RM in 3-5 sets of 20-25 reps, depending on the training level of the novice. Development of maximal strength: Use loads between 70% to 100% of RM. Usually 3 or 4 sets of decreasing numbers of repetitions are implemented with an increasing load such as: 6-8 reps at 70%, 4-5 reps at 85%, 2-3 reps at 90-95%, and one rep at 100%. The methodologies for the development of maximal strength are, normally, quite intense during both the physical exertion and the recovery phases. Maximal strength development generates stimulations either on the nervous system or on the metabolic system often leaving the novice exhausted. Attempting technical gestures, such as those required to shoot an arrow, while exhausted or not sufficiently recovered often results in modifications in the tensions and the contraction sequences of the muscles normally used. Consequently, loss of fluidity during the various steps of the shooting sequence may occur. Worse than that, the novice may inadvertently use unusual muscles or muscle groups to compensate for any temporary strength deficit resulting from the fatigue of the proper ones. The consequence is generally a sensorial modification of the posture and of the action itself due to a variation of self-perception. Therefore, it is critical that specific archery training occurs only after sufficient recovery time has passed after a strength training session. Finally, it is important to note that, for an archer, the physical preparation must be in service to the sport-specific actions and not the other way around. If properly implemented and monitored, a strength training program will be a benefit to the archer, providing a better foundation for the shot and its requisite movements."}

Postural body control Ideally, an archer should shoot from a stable, balanced and erect posture. To achieve this, the novice must have a strong foundation connected through the feet, legs, hips, back and shoulder all the way to the head with no weak links The muscles of the feet and legs continuously and imperceptibly adapt their tension to maintain and control the archer’s balance. In the same way, the gluteus and quadriceps (mainly the wide medial) muscles provide stability as far as the thigh muscles are concerned. In this case, the gluteus muscles have the distinction of being very near to the novice’s core and, therefore, are able (even with very small contractions) to balance or unbalance the bow/archer unit. The back muscles give crucial stability to the novice and generate the required stiffness. “Stiffness” is the level of rigidity and compactness that the muscular-tendinous system generates during loading situations. These muscles dynamically control, easily and without a high level of wasted energy, the posture of the upper section of the body as a whole. The back muscles must be precisely employed, not only to allow correct and efficient operations, but also to avoid risk of injury. Postural considerations generally take up much of the focus during a novice’s first steps, either for obvious technical reasons related to stability and balance or for constructive reasons concerning the development of the novice and of the practice process. A strong trunk muscular system, in particular the back, is essential to maintaining an ergonomic and effectual posture during the act of shooting. The stable and solid positioning of the other body segments is directly related to the efficiency of the trunk muscular districts. If we imagine the backbone and its muscles as the mainmast of a ship, we see that failures or tension deficit are unfavourable to the correct execution of technical actions. \nIn addition, an inadequate core strongly increases the risk of injury or pain caused by incorrect postural behaviour resulting from the lack of strength required to support the positions assumed by the novice while shooting. The positioning of the different body segments (the scapula, the neck, the pelvis and so on) depends on the archer’s capacity to generate stiffness. When possible, it is advisable to introduce some asymmetric exercises using an unstable platform in order for the novice to experience and learn to control destabilising influences. 11.4.1.1. Core exercises on stable support Static or semi-static postures are the first step in a series of physical exercises designed to build up a solid posture with a high level of proprioception. Proprioception is the capacity to perceive and to recognize the body’s position in space and the degree of muscle contraction, even without visual cues. As such, good proprioception is essential in archery. The object of the following exercises must always be to get the alignment of the ankle-knee-hip-shoulder-head axis as precise as possible (*). These elements must be kept in a straight line as a result of the continuous muscular contractions happening throughout the body. (*) One of the basic archery skills that the novice must develop – See Chapter 1 “Activity Description and Archer’s Skills” and also section 6.11.1 “The importance of keeping the shoulders and hips directly above the feet.” As is the case for strengthening, these exercises can grouped based on the part of the body they target. It is up to the coach to select some of them when preparing sessions. Do not try to do all of them in the same session because it would take too long, leaving no time for shooting. For the first sessions, one or two exercise(s) per targeted body part is enough. These exercises can be performed in in any order. Start with 1 set, then progress to 2 then 3 sets of each exercise with variable"}

Core exercises on unstable support The concept is to have the novice learn to control their balance while moving one part of the body or holding an unstable posture. These exercises are necessary when the classic postures are not efficient enough for the demands of the activity. In this case, when the novice is no longer being challenged by the exercises above, it is necessary to introduce some more difficult elements in order to create situations where the novice is obliged to reset his motor scheme. The use of one or more “Medicine balls” or “Stability balls” can be very useful. For the following exercises, use the low range of the implementation recommendations as for the “Core exercises on stable support” in 11.4.1.1. as a guide for duration. 1. Unstable plank postures It is possible to increase the efficacy of the basic plank exercises by creating a source of instability in either the hand supports, the foot supports or both. The three following images depict possible variations for increasing the difficulty of a plank posture. \n Low plank on a ball \n High plank on an unstable base \n High plank on three balls 2. Balancing on a stability ball By removing direct contact with the ground and supporting the entire weight on a stability ball, the novice is required to engage their core to maintain balance. \n Seated Sitting on the ball with arms and legs extended requires that the appendages be manipulated from the core to maintain balance. \n Prone plane Lying with the belly on the ball and arms and legs extended and maintaining a straight body position from heels to head requires good core engagement, especially from the back muscles, for balance as well as maintaining full extension."}

Body control with load in suspension These exercises voluntarily introduce a loss of equilibrium, (and recovery!), of the entire erect and aligned posture through the contraction of the tibia and fibula muscles. This will enable the novice to recover from a greater unbalancing angle, be it backward, forward, lateral, or a mixture. One of the strongest advantages of the following exercises comes from their involvement of almost every supporting muscle, working the feet to the neck and everything in between. Every muscular element is engaged in order to maintain a stable posture. Additionally these exercises present a low risk of injury or overloading the backbone with an excess of weight or activity. The exercises are normally performed with the added weight being proportional to the novice’s level of conditioning. For example, young novices generally work with a bar plus round weights varying from 5 to 15 kg. The degree of load must challenge the novice to work moderately to maintain balance, but be sufficiently light that correct execution and body control can be sustained. a) Walking In the early stages, the novice simply walks with a weight held overhead. The primary goal is to maintain an erect posture and stable equilibrium. Three types of walk are proposed below: \n Walk on heels only, keeping toes lifted off the ground."}

These simple walks are done for about 2 or 3 sets of 20 metre “reps.” Performing these walks on an incline generates better efficacy in the gluteus region. Alternately if the walks take place in sand, there is better engagement of the foot-leg district (gastrocnemius, fibular, tibial and foot muscles). Once the novice is able to control these easier walks, more complicated walks can be considered, such as skipping, running with a back kick, running with a front kick, jumps and skips of any kinds and in any directions, with one or both feet. The level \nof difficulty increases proportionally to the adaptation. Maintaining posture with an overhead load during a simple movement is relatively easy, while maintaining the same overhead weight at higher speed and/or with large swings of various body segments is much more complicated with respect to coordination and requisite strength. \n b) Challenge of balance This exercise starts from an erect position supporting a weight. The weight must always be at a level commensurate to the ability of the novice, usually between 5 and 10 Kg. The exercises are normally performed through a voluntary challenge to the equilibrium in the front-back plane or in the lateral plane. The subsequent recovery occurs through a sequence of muscular contractions without losing the alignment of the posture. Imagine a straight line passing through a projection of the novice’s centre of gravity on the ground, their core and their head. This line must never be broken. When the novice reaches a high level of skill these exercises can be done on a wobble board or a balance beam. These exercises can be performed at any time during training sessions, either during shooting sessions or the physical conditioning sessions. The number of repetitions is varies depending on the novice's ability level. Generally 15 to 20 seconds of exercises repeated 2 to 3 times"}

Strengthening with body weight In most cases the novice can use a part or all of their body weight for their strengthening routine. In addition, free-standing exercises, without the use of machines, generally produce better results when proper form is used. The following exercises are good general exercises and also strengthen the ankle-knee-hip-shoulder-head alignment. Leg crossing \n Alternately pass one leg under the other one In addition to being an excellent general warm-up exercise, leg crossing (pictured above) strengthens the core and the muscles used to draw the bow.

Repeat for 3 sets of 10 reps. Exercises to improve foot articulation The following exercises work on the foot articulation, developing the muscular-tendinous apparatus, making them stronger and more toned as well as more mobile. Therefore, in addition to being able to support the archer’s weight more easily and for longer periods, the muscles will be able to adapt better to the ground and changing conditions without losing precision in the feedback. The exercises include: • A series of intra and extra rotations of the tibia-tarsus section (ankle articulation) with controlled moves. • Pronations and supinations with a stop at the maximum point of articulation. • Plantar bending. Below are two example of possible exercises. \n The efficacy of the described exercises is increased if they are done barefoot, or better, in the sand. \nExercises loading the gastrocnemius (calf) Often called a “calf-raise,” this is a simple exercise of maximal extension performed using a simple step. Standing on the step, the athlete allows their heels to drop down as low as possible and then rises onto their toes to maximal height. This exercise is intended to be done “at maximum” repetitions, meaning that the novice ends the series when the burning sensation, during the lift does not allow a full raise. Generally, the exercise is done in 3-4 sets of 20-30 reps. When the novice reaches the above working volumes with no difficulties, they should increase the challenge by using only one leg at a time. Later they can add either some overload (ballasted jacket, dumbbells or a barbell), or a balance component to the exercise. \n Calf-raise starting and finishing position Exercises loading the leg muscles Proper methodology suggests starting with exercises using a natural load (i.e. the novice uses only their own body weight). This is due not only to the obvious reasons of safety and protection, but also to allow the novice to learn the posture and body sensations of the unusual working situations. A high degree of postural control is necessary to avoid osteo-articular problems. As is often the case, the exercises have dual functions: firstly the development of a conditional parameter (in this case the strength) is pursued, and secondly proprioception-postural awareness and improvement (control of the body during exercises engaging medium to high intensities)."}

Nevertheless, it is still important to control the breathing rhythm during each exercise. Novices have a tendency to hold their breath during isometric exercises, resulting in an anaerobic effort that produces excess lactic acid, which spoils the exercise. Since control of the breath is a key aspect in archery technique, implementing a breathing sequence for strength training sessions is natural and reinforces the sport-specific application. It is also useful to remember that the described exercises must be distributed throughout the week or overall training cycle and not practiced all together in the same session. Ideally the coach will set priorities for the training sessions (either metabolic, or according to targeted body part/region) in order to plan the novice’s adaptations to achieve a primary objective for the single session or for the whole training period. This must be planned according to the competition calendar and specific technical targets. Exercise loading gluteus from a quadruped position – out-stretched limb Start in a hands-and-knees position with the arms and thighs at right angles to the ground. Slowly lift one leg, straighten it, and then raise it as high as possible in the air before returning to the start position. Repeat for 3 sets of 10 reps per leg. The exercise is demonstrated in the following 2 pictures. \n Gluteus from quadruped position out-stretched limb \n11.4.3. Strengthening with an elastic resistance Not all novices have access to high-tech workout machines. Fortunately, a rubber strengthening band is sufficient for the novice to get a good workout. For those athletes who do have access to machines, it is still advisable, especially in the initial stages of the physical training, to use free-standing exercises. Specific machines often “drive” the execution of the exercise, reducing its effectiveness. Using various elastic resistances, or the same elastic held at different distances, the required effort from the novice can be reduced or increased to suit their needs and ability level. When using an elastic resistance band, 2 to 3 sets of 10 repetitions, or 20 seconds of isometric hold, or any combination of these two alternatives are appropriate. Exercises for the legs Exercises loading the leg abductors Start from a standing position, sideways to a solid support with an elastic resistance band affixed and looped around the ankle of the leg furthest from the support.

However, they also quite often prevent the user from adapting other muscle groups to the movement. As a consequence, the creation of more complex kinetic chains and adaptive motor schemes is blocked. For this reason, these exercise machines produce better results with more advanced archers, who need only specific “corrections” in particular muscle groups. In such a case, the machine helps them to achieve more than they would using of the normal exercises."}

More mass weight Shoot with a heavier mass-weight bow for at least 40 minutes to improve the specific strength required to hold the bow up at full draw. To increase the mass weight: wear a weight-band on both wrists or on the string wrist and attach one wrist weight to the bottom part of the riser. Recommended additional weight on each wrist: • Girls: ½ pound • Women & boys: ¾ pound • Men: 1 pound Shoot at a regular pace, without rushing or taking breaks.

This last variation exercise has the further advantage of helping prepare the archer for shooting in windy conditions. 11.4.6.2. More bow tension (drawing weight) The easiest way to increase the bow tension is to have the novice shoot with limbs that are about 10% heavier (roughly 2 pounds) than the normal ones. If heavier limbs are not available, loop an elastic resistance band around the string elbow and the bow, passing through the bow fingers of the novice. Use the extra bow weight for a minimum of 40 minutes, or even up to 80% of the session. Conclude the exercise by immediately shooting 3 additional ends without the extra weight. Always shoot at least 3 arrows per end and as in the previous exercise, all archers must shoot at the same time in a single shooting line. Shoot without rushing but also with no breaks during the exercise. When using an elastic band (highly suggested), it should be 2 meters long: • Girls: ½” wide • Women & boys: ¾” wide • Men: 1” wide Chose a good quality elastic band from a sewing supply store. Make a loop or harness for the string elbow and knot, or better sew, it at a length that provides the resistance needed by the novice. \n Naturally, there are many other ways to generate a higher bow weight or drawing tension with an elastic aid; three possible options are shown below. \n With two (light) elastics \n Or with one (light) elastic Another way to use an elastic band, is to loop it around the bow and hold it at the position that the arrow would be nocked with the string fingers as shown below. In this case no arrow is used and the bow is drawn and let-down rather than shooting an arrow."}

More arrows / shots Two options can be considered to accomplish this: • More arrows during each practice session; • More shots as a consequence of more practice sessions. More arrows during a single practice session This alternative is generally used for entry-level archers, since usually they can only practice during scheduled classes. The coach has several alternatives to allow the novices to more shots per session: • Extend the duration of the classes; • Reduce, as much as possible, the non-shooting time during the classes; • Have the novice shoot more arrows per end; • Combine any of the above alternatives. More shots as a consequence of more practice sessions This solution is used more by archers who have more access to their equipment, the coach and an available range. Keep in mind that there is a safety concern in allowing a very new beginner to take equipment home, since they may shoot arrows unsafely. A safe solution, allowing the novice to shoot a bow without an arrow, is shown below. \n \n \nIn this system, the elastic band stops the string just before it returns to rest and is less violent for the bow than the shot of an arrow. For most of the entry level bow weights, a good quality elastic band from a sewing supply store will suffice to catch the string and be durable enough for prolonged use. Make a loop or harness for the string elbow and knot, or better sew, the elastic at a length that provides the proper slowing-down of the bow string. The sound upon release will be a good indicator; it should be low and smooth. Depending on the draw length and arm size of the novice, an elastic band about 1.75 m long and 3 cm wide should do. Some of the other advantages of this simple and inexpensive device are: • Upon release, the novice does not attempt to watch the arrow flight; hence they stay focused on the follow-through of his/her shooting form; • It strengthens the release, eliminating any tendency to collapse upon release; • It allows practice when there is not enough time to go back and forth to the archery venue. Because there are no arrows to collect, plenty of shots can be made in only half an hour; • It also allows the novice to shoot in front of a mirror, which provides valuable visual feedback. After a while, the same exercise can be done with a non-elastic device connecting the string elbow and the bow string. In this case, the movement of the string upon release should be quite small, no more than 10 cm at most, as a rigid connection is harder on the string shoulder than an elastic one."}

Burst of arrows – Short rests The exercise immediately above works well for this purpose since it allows the novice to shoot many shots within a short period of time because no time is spent loading or collecting the arrows. Running for arrow collection is another way to reduce the rest between ends, even over the short shooting distances used by novices. Please be aware, however, that due to safety precautions the archers should not run whilst holding the arrows in their hand. They should be safely contained in a substantial quiver. Finally, resting less between arrows while on the shooting line is another alternative. In this situation the coach must be sure that the novices do not shoot faster than their usual time for the shot execution. The time is saved between arrows, not during the shot process itself. 11.4.6.5. Holding for a long time at full draw This is an old, popular and efficient way to develop the specific strength of the archer. The coach should start by asking the novices to stay three times longer than usual at full draw (approximately 8 seconds) for three consecutive draws. When the novice can maintain their form for a 8-second hold (no creeping, form deformation or shaking, etc.), the coach increases the difficulty by a) Extending the time at full draw up to 11 seconds; b) Extending the time at full draw up to 14 seconds; c) Adding one more set - i.e. four attempts of 14 seconds each; d) Extending the time at full draw up to 17 seconds; e) Extending the time at full draw up to 20 seconds; f) Adding one more set - i.e. five attempts of 20 seconds each. Between each long hold, allow the novices to rest for 150% of the holding time - i.e. 15 seconds of rest when holding for 10 seconds, or 30 seconds of rest when holding for 20 seconds. \n11.4.6.6. Combinations When the novice is experienced with the above exercises, they can start using them in various combinations. Two suggestions for combinations are depicted below. \n Long hold with heavier bow weight (drawing tension) \n \n Reduced rests with heavier bow (more mass)"}

CONCLUSION FINAL REMARKS: The objective of this chapter has been to provide the level 1 archery coach with a consistent “package” of simple and effective exercises. Implementing the movements described above in a planned training environment will help the novice become a skilled archer or even an elite athlete competing around the world. It is impossible in a manual such as this to be completely comprehensive and therefore there are many omissions. Even the concepts that are included have only been very briefly covered. The main goal of this chapter, however, was to give short operational and methodological indications and to perhaps “open some doors’’ about concepts that may have been unknown, or even worse, underestimated. If some readers get the desire to increase their knowledge through additional study, the most important purpose of this work will be achieved. In this case, the archers will be grateful as will the whole archery movement.

Working in a fun and dynamic way on things such as time pressure or aiming off among other important aspects of shooting without the normal stress of competition is beneficial to archers at every level. This chapter suggests some games which can be adapted depending on available time, numbers of archers/teams, equipment, etc. When setting up the distances keep in mind the ability levels and the bow classes of the archers you are working with. Quite often, the “scoring” system can be modified. Have fun trying out your own variations tailored to the specific group of participating archers. For most of these events, bows, arrows and target butts will be needed, but not always. These games are a great way to end classes or keep long-term archers engaged and improving their form and competitive ability. 60 Seconds Rowdy ● Equipment: Butts, bows, arrows, 80cm, 60cm or 40cm target face, stopwatch or clock. ● Game objectives: Ignore distractions while shooting, distract others while they shoot. ● Shooting distance: Variable, depends on archers’ ability levels and bow class(es). ● Number of archers: Two or more individuals. ● Number of arrows: Depends on the archers’ abilities, the number of ends is equal to the number of archers so everyone can be “The Rowdy” for an end. ● Rules: Each end lasts exactly 60 seconds. One archer is designated to be “The Rowdy” for each end. The other archers shoot as many arrows as they can. The Rowdy has to try to disturb the archers by making loud noises, telling jokes or stories, whistling, singing, etc. The Rowdy must stay a safe distance from the archers and may not touch them in any way. The points the archers score go to that end’s designated Rowdy. Each end another archer is designated to be the Rowdy until everyone has had a turn. The winner is the one who has the lowest score. ● Skill emphasized: Maximal accuracy during stress. ● Variation: If there is only one archer and one Rowdy per end, the Rowdy may touch or pinch the shooting archer softly only around the torso and legs, but not the arms. The Rowdy \nshould not push the shooting archer but is however allowed to blow at the archer. 300 ● Equipment: Butts, bows, arrows, target face drawn like a dartboard. ● Game objective: Score as many points as possible per end and reach zero first. ● Shooting distance: Variable, depends on archers’ ability levels and bow class(es). ● Number of archers: individual, teams of two, teams of three. ● Number of arrows per end: Individual, six arrows; teams of two, three arrows per archer; teams of three, two arrows each. ● Rules: Each team or individual starts with 300 points. The score shot per end is subtracted. The winner is the first archer to reduce their score exactly to zero. If the score is under zero the end doesn’t count. ● Skill emphasized: Maximal accuracy and aiming off."}

Variation: on one knee. The winner is the archer with the highest score after a predetermined number of ends (often 5). ● Skill emphasized: Maximal accuracy under stress, body balance, self-evaluation and tactics. \nBasketball ● Equipment: Butts, bows, arrows, basketball target face (easily made by the coach or by the archers themselves). ● Game objective: Hit the basket and the balls and score as many points as possible. ● Shooting distance: Variable, depends on archers’ ability levels and bow class(es). Rather than varying the distances, different sizes of balls and baskets on target faces can be used to even out skill level and equipment advantages. ● Number of archers: Any number of individuals, up to four per target (have two lines if four archers are sharing a target). ● Number of arrows: Four arrows per archer. ● Rules: With the first three arrows of the end try to hit the balls.

Variations: The archer or team must “call their shot,” i.e. identify the target ball they are trying to hit prior to shooting. Sink the balls in numerical order. Sink the eight ball after sinking all the correct balls to win. Hit an opponent’s ball or the eight ball during play and lose a turn. Hit a ball from the opponent’s set and the opponent may count it as sunk. ● Skill emphasized: Maximal accuracy and tactics. ● Variation: The second arrow can hit the billiard balls from the other archer/ team, this ball can then be crossed out by them. \n Blind Arrows ● Equipment: Butts, bows, arrows, 80cm, 60cm or 40cm target face. ● Game objective: Combine blind shooting with aiming, make the highest score. ● Shooting distance: First end: 3-5m; second end: variable, depends on archers’ ability levels and bow class(es). ● Number of archers: Individuals or teams of two. ● Number of arrows: Individuals shoot six arrows per end; teams of two shoot three arrow each per end. ● Rules: Odd-numbered ends are shot blind (i.e. the eyes are closed after reaching anchor) and even-numbered ends are shot normally.

Introduction: This World Archery Beginners’ Award Program Manual is a guide for beginner archers and their Level 1 archery coaches. 13.1.1. To the Level 1 Archery Coaches: Thank you for promoting archery! This guide will help coaches in properly educating novices in archery and in evaluating their progress. We encourage you to make regular use of the World Archery Level 1 Coaching Manual and/or audio-visual document in your coaching activities. 13.1.2. To the Beginner Archers: Congratulations on taking up Archery! This chapter presents the curriculum of each of the 7 levels of the World Archery Beginners’ Awards Program. It will help you to develop your general shooting skills, knowledge of archery and performance. Your progress will be encouraged and rewarded by the earning of World Archery Beginners’ Award pins. After completion of the Entry level program, you will be encouraged to take part in some World Archery tournaments, through which you can win other World Archery awards specific to each archery discipline. World Archery wishes you a life of enjoyment within the World Archery family. 13.1.3. The World Archery Beginners’ Awards Program at a glance: The World Archery Beginners’ Awards Program has been designed to be implemented in all countries of the world at any time; incorporating Indoor and Outdoor disciplines. Up to seven awards lead the novice: • from a very short shooting distance - 6 to 10 meters, depending on the archer’s age; • to the shortest Indoor distance - 18 meters, but on a bigger target face than the World Archery official one for this distance; • and even further – to 26 meters on an 80 cm target face, which is close to the first World Archery Outdoor distance, 30 meters. This process is not only based on score, since skills, knowledge and know-how are also \nassessed; hence the main goal of the World Archery Beginners’ Awards Program (BAP) is the archer’s education as a whole. 13.2. Overall presentation 13.2.1. Goals: World Archery has produced this manual to guide beginners in assessing their progress during the long period covering the entry-level program before they compete in official tournaments. 13.2.2. Evaluation principle To earn any of the World Archery Beginners’ Awards, you have to reach a minimum level of: • score; • skill development; • Knowledge and/or know-how. 13.2.2.1. SCORE Your performance is evaluated at reduced shooting distances and number of shots. At each stage, 15 arrows are shot at an 80cm target face See the evaluation form for the shooting distance for each award level. 13.2.2.2. SKILLS DEVELOPMENT The achievement of a good score is only a consequence of well-implemented skills, as described in the World Archery level 1 Coaching Manual. Thus, for each development level, some skills are expected to be acquired. Their assessment is based on some key elements described in the World Archery Entry Level 1 Coaching Manual. If you need help in evaluating these skills, do not hesitate to consult this reference manual. To help with your training, collaborating with an archery coach is also strongly recommended 13.2.2.3.

The awards are pins and can be displayed, on the quiver for instance. \n13.2.5. Recommended examination guidelines for awards Develop a schedule of specific sessions for challenging the World Archery Beginners’ Awards and require a minimum attendance in entry-level practice sessions to be eligible to take part in an evaluation session. For instance: Schedule a specific session for challenging the World Archery Beginners’ Awards every 2 months; open only to those who have attended at least 7 practice sessions during the two preceding months. To challenge for a World Archery Beginners’ Award, those who have attended less than 7 practice sessions will have to wait until the next specific challenge session and complete at least 7 practice sessions before then. Beginners who fail some components of the evaluation may re-challenge these items only, but they must retrain on all the modules failed and the reassessment/evaluation cannot be retaken until the full program is completed. All novices must start by challenging the Red Feather or the White Arrow. Starting at any other level would make it difficult to evaluate the skills, knowledge and know-how that were supposed to have been learned previously."}

Skills FEET POSITION (Stance) Objective: Consistency in positioning and spacing relative to the archer, the shooting line and the target, achieving optimal stability. Form: Feet parallel on the shooting axis, set at approximately shoulder width. Rationale: This stance gives the archers the opportunity to repeat actions easily and accurately, and provides sound support to the pull and push efforts in the shooting plane. It gives consistent direction to the body in the shooting plane and avoids back problems. \n Proper stance on the shooting line \nSafe and proper arrow loading Objective: Identical placement of the arrow on the bow. The action must be performed in a safe manner to protect the archer, the other archers, and the equipment. Form: Hold the arrow by the nock, place the arrow on the rest, correctly orient the arrow*, and nock it on the string. (*) Arrows with four vanes do not require orientation and more quickly stabilize the arrow on its trajectory. \n Taking an arrow out of the quiver \n Arrow loading Rationale: Taking hold of the arrow in front of the vanes makes nocking more difficult and risks damaging the fletching if the hand slips during the nocking process. A finger must not be used to hold the arrow on the arrow rest since the rest does not endure strong vertical pressure and could be damaged."}

Nocks are very sharp. Pick up all arrows that have fallen short of the target, regardless of who their owner may be. Make sure that no one is directly behind the person pulling the arrows. Arrows can come out of a target suddenly and the nock may hurt anyone who is too close. Bending over in front of the target is dangerous, as you may hit an arrow either while bending or straightening up. You should wait beside the target to collect arrows. To pull an arrow out of the target, press one palm hand flat around the arrow sticking in the target. With the other hand, grab the arrow shaft close to the target face and pull out the arrow in line with the shaft and without bending the arrow shaft. When pulling an arrow out of the grass, do not pull the arrow straight up; you could bend or break the arrow shaft. Instead, move the grass away from the fletchings, especially if you are using natural feathers and pull the shaft back in line with the shaft and along the grass. When the point is out of the grass you can lift the arrow up. BOW ASSEMBLY: You must learn from your coach how to properly mount the limbs onto and remove them from the riser (if you use a takedown bow). An assembled Recurve bow that has not been braced has the tips of the limbs towards the target (not towards you) when your hand is properly in the grip. On some older bows, due to a former World Archery rule, the internal part (the side facing you when your hand is properly in the grip) of the top limbs is blank, while the limb specifications (length and weight) are written in the internal part of the bottom limb, as shown on the illustration below. \n The technical specifications of the limbs are often written on the internal part of the bottom limb"}

Skills BODY SETTING (from before drawing until full draw) Objective: Provide an identical, stable foundation that promotes a consistent repetition of upper body actions as well as optimal general balance. It should also allow for positioning the aiming eye at the same stable spot in the space on each shot. Imagine the aiming eye as the top of the “big pyramid” (your coach will instruct you on the pyramid system – refer to sections 6.5.1. Complementary Knowledge and 6.10. Complementary Knowledge for details) Form: Most novices are slightly bent over while setting up the string and bow hands. Moving from a bent over position to an upright one creates a good base at the beginning of the execution process of the shot. \n38\nPre-positioning of the Body\nFrom a bent forward position ……to being straight \nInhale\n/Inhale\nPreparatory Movements\nPascal Colmaire –Development & Education Director of FITA \nThe following illustrations present alternative ways to pre-set the body. From Left to Right and Top to bottom: • Stay upright with flat and straight back; • Head stretched upwards; • Flat chest - Do not move the chest up when stretching the head up; • At the same time, keep the shoulders low and down; • Feel a strong lower body, and feel the body weight spread on both feet; • Feel a strong belly and a low centre of gravity; \nPre-positioning of the Body\nPreparatory Movements\nPascal Colmaire –Development & Education Director of FITA\nKeep the entire body in the shooting plane with shoulders above hips and feet; • Turn the head toward the target; • A little less weight on heels than on the front part of the feet; • The illustration on the right hand side summarizes the vertical firmness well. LEGS Form: The legs form an upside-down \"V\" that is symmetrical around the vertical axis going through the head. Weight is placed as equally on both feet as possible. Rationale: The body weight is distributed approximately equally on both legs. Swaying in the vertical plane is reduced because the body weight is slightly forward (toward toes). The string leg participates in the production of the push while the bow leg contributes to the pull. The two efforts strengthen your vertical body axis and generate a downward pressure, providing a solid foundation for upper body work and good stability."}

Form: Turn or tilt the pelvis backwards (flattening the lower back), and stretch the spine up while keeping the shoulders in the same plane as the hips. Lower your shoulders and flatten your chest - you may feel a slight stretching in the trapezius muscles. Turn your head toward the target (whilst maintaining the stretching up action) until your nose is directed toward the target. Rationale: Stretching-up your head and spine assures an erect vertical stance. Tilting your pelvis, flattening your chest and the lowering your shoulders lower the centre of gravity, making your body more stable. Furthermore it transfers energy from the upper body to the lower body, helping you to relax. Shoulders and the head are close to their final position, thus minimizing movement during the draw. BODY SETTING (end of draw) Objective: Draw the bow without disturbing the pre-set position achieved above. In fact, maintain this body position until after the shot. \n Draw made in the shooting plane \nThe top and bottom body remain well in place during the draw and end of draw Form: A balance between the production of traction and repulsion (pull and push) forces must be"}

As previously noted, these pull and push efforts are supported by the legs. Always stay in control, keeping momentum movements to a minimal or non-existent level. The drawing motion diminishes in speed as you near the facial reference, but it does not stop. The torso remains almost immobile. If there was no pre-draw, a slight rotation of the chest, aligning the shoulders with the shooting plane may occur. The body is vertical or leans slightly toward the string leg. The shoulders remain low and the head remains in place and extended up - it should not move toward the string during the draw. The arrow always remains parallel to the ground and the string moves straight to the face in the shooting plane. Rationale: This form is easy to duplicate because the foundation stays in place, the movement is simple, and control is easily preserved. Striving for symmetry will maintain balance in the shot. The production of effort is dispersed, which facilitates achieving symmetry, reduces local fatigue effects, and minimizes the risk of injury. The major muscles are used to generate the effort and full drawing effort is attained as soon as the draw approaches the face, which enhances the control of the shot. Because the beginning of the draw is faster, the archer saves energy. 13.3.3.3. KNOWLEDGE AND/OR KNOW-HOW BOW BRACING: Your coach will most likely have your bow strung before the start of the first two or three practice sessions. Stringing and unstringing of the bow is usually taught on the third or fourth session when the students are a little more familiar with the equipment. Below we recommend some safe methods for stringing the bow. A loop stringer is inexpensive, easy to use and makes the task of stringing the bow almost effortless. Like any other stringing methods, it is necessary to check the string positioning before taking the bow stringer pressure off the upper limb tip. Place a small piece of carpet or rubber on hard and rough ground to prevent damage to the lower limb tip. A tip protector on the lower limb would also serve this function \nand also help keep the string loop in the proper location. \n Use of a string loop with 2 feet \n Use of a string loop with 1 foot You also can buy a bow stringer like the one show below from any archery shop. They are a little tricky to use properly at first, but over time and with experience they become simple and reliable tools."}

It is made of 2 pieces of metal cylinder, wrapped with something to protect the limbs, and affixed to a wall or pole. \n \nRANGE SAFETY: Under no circumstances should anyone shoot if someone is downrange on the field. Arrows may glance off the targets or depart from their intended path. The shooting line should be straight, not staggered. When in a group where archers are not shooting at the same distance, it is safest to have the targets at the desired distances and all the archers on the same shooting line. \n SAFETY and ETIQUETTE on the SHOOTING LINE: Only draw your bow back if you are on the shooting line. Never draw the bow with your bow hand higher than your drawing hand, and you should not shoot “cross-court” (toward a target that is not straight ahead) unless specifically directed to (for a competition or game, for instance). Avoid talking on the line or otherwise distracting other archers during the shooting of the end. Leave it to the coach to critique any archer’s technique, but encouraging remarks are welcome at any time. If your bow or arrow falls in front of the shooting line and you can reach it without leaving the shooting line, ensure that the archers on either side of you have their bows down at their sides before retrieving your equipment. Any arrow which cannot be retrieved without moving your feet on the shooting line should only be retrieved after shooting has stopped."}

RAISING THE BOW: Objective: Perform the preliminary movements with as little unnecessary motion and disruption to initial positioning as possible. This initial positioning must allow for an effective draw. Form: Synchronized raising of the two hands towards the target until both hands are level with the nose. Throughout the process: • the bow shoulder must stay as low as possible; • the upper body (shoulders, chest and centre of gravity) stays in its lowest position; • the arrow must be stay within the shooting plane as it is moved up; • the head and spine stay extended; • the pelvis remains tilted (if this position is chosen). Toward the end of the raising: • both hands are moved up to the same level; • the arrow is parallel to the ground; At the end of the raising: • the arrow is at the nose/eyes level; • the string shoulder is lower than the arrow shaft; • the string wrist is in line with the string forearm; • a slight backward inclination of the torso toward the string foot is acceptable, but a straight body is recommended. Rationale: The simplicity of the movement makes it easy to repeat. It is a safe starting position for the draw, even if an arrow is inadvertently released. Raising the arms in this manner only slightly changes the body elements already in position, if at all. . The forces exerted on the \nupper body facilitate the low positioning of the shoulders. The body's inclination toward the string foot counter balances the weight of the bow and moves the archer's centre of gravity away from the target (the use of bows with light mass weight will reduce this inclination). \n 13.4.2.3.

Performance: Shooting distance: 14 meters Minimum required score: 115 points 13.4.3.2. Skills – Your shooting sequence should include the following: DRAW PROCESS: See the “The Upper Body” section of the “Skills” from the Gold Arrow curriculum. FULL DRAW (the hold) Objective: Body and equipment stability for effective aiming. Holding the bow at full draw without collapsing from the bow's draw weight or mass. Form: With the body in an upright position and keeping the torso still, let the chest and shoulders exert a steady downward effort while seeking to spread out the shoulders. Maintain an erect spine and head. Strike a balance between the push and pull forces, supported by an equal use of both legs and an engaged abdominal area. The constants are: • the distance between the arrow and the bow shoulder in the horizontal plane; • the distance between the chin and bow shoulder; • the height difference between the arrow and the bow shoulder in the vertical plane; • the height of the shoulders; • the bow's vertical position; • The positions of the torso and head. Rationale: This form strongly opposes the spring effect of the bow, which can cause the archer to collapse, and draws in the chest, facilitating string displacement. The production of effort is dispersed, which facilitates achieving symmetry, reduces local fatigue effects, and minimizes the risk of injury. Moreover, major muscles are used in generating the movement and effort and promote stretching the spine helping the archer stay erect and vertical. Flattening the chest and lowering the shoulders \nlowers the centre of gravity, making the body more stable. The combination of the above actions contributes to maintaining the draw length and helps to keep the head and the aiming eye at a constant level. Furthermore a certain level of muscle tone is necessary; weak muscles will probably collapse under the spring effect of the bow. 13.4.3.2.

Instead it may hang loose from the point of the arrow and lay down along the target face. If this happens, shooting on that target butt should cease until the arrow is removed. If shooting continues at a target with a dangling arrow, other arrows may hit it causing damage to either the hanging arrow or the one that strikes it. The striking arrow may also ricochet off the hanging arrow. Arrows should always be straight. Usually small bends in aluminium arrows do not affect a beginner's accuracy. Straightness can be checked by eye, down the shaft, or by spinning the arrow and noting wobble or vibration. Rolling the shaft along a table can also be used to check straightness. \n Always check shafts for damage such as splits, chips or compression lines as these make the arrows dangerous to use and inaccurate. \n Always check shafts for damage such as splits, chips or compression lines as these make the arrows dangerous to use and inaccurate If there are no splits in a wooden or aluminium shaft, but there is a bend in it, a shaft straightening tool can be used.

Performance: Shooting distance: 18 meters Minimum required score: 115 points 13.4.4.2. Skills – Your shooting sequence should include the following: STRING GRIP (String Hook) Objective: Consistent finger positioning on the string, about the arrow Form: The fingers grip the string between the two upper joints. The palm of the hand is relaxed and the back of the hand is flat. \n In most of the unsighted methods, three fingers are used and positioned beneath the arrow. In the shaft aiming method (straight line), the space between the nock and the forefinger is about two to three fingers’ width, depending on facial bone structure and size of string fingers. \n The three fingers share the workload equally. The back of the hand remains as vertical as possible, not curled-up, with the wrist as flat as possible. The interior of the forearm remains relaxed. Consequently, the hand is in the same axis, or vertical plane, as the forearm and arrow. \n With a proper string hook, the back of the hand and the wrist are flat (Example for sight use) Rationale: A “deep” string grip in the fingers allows the muscles of the string hand, arm and forearm to relax from the string side. The more relaxed these body parts are, the less they interfere with the string and the cleaner the string releases from the fingers. FACIAL MARKS: Straight line: The archer looks straight along the arrow shaft to the point of aim on the target. \n This aiming style has its advantages: • simple visual alignment of the arrow shaft on the centre of the target is enough, no need to repeat the facial marks at full draw (see triangle and quadrilateral methods described further down in this chapter); • the aiming eye positioning in reference with the shooting plane is automatic (hence no need for string alignment); • no concern about applying a vertical finger pressure on the arrow (upward or downward) with the string fingers."}

The arrow is positioned by two reference points: • The arrow point, by visual placement of a sight on the target; • The arrow nock, through tactile placement of the string hand on the face. \n \n Furthermore, to ensure consistent repetition of the quadrilateral method, the archer must maintain: • the bow in the vertical plane or consistently canted the same amount; • a consistent draw length; • the position of the aiming eye for string alignment."}

Form: Your string forearm should be as much as possible in the vertical plane passing through the arrow. Rationale: In terms of required effort, this position is the most efficient. Furthermore it allows the muscles in the string arm, forearm and wrist to stay relaxed. The relaxation of these muscles facilitates the use of the muscles located in the back and behind the string shoulder. \n FEELING ATTENTION: In order to get a better kinaesthetic perception (physical feeling) of the skill and, in this case, the string hand, shoot at a very short distance (about 3 meters) with your eyes closed and focus on the feeling of the shot. Shooting at an empty buttress (nothing to aim at) with your eyes open also makes it easier to sense physical perceptions. 13.4.4.3. Knowledge and/or Know-how BOW KNOWLEDGE: You should be able to give the overall description of 3 types of bow. The following gives a general description of the Recurve, Compound and Bare-bow. Recurve: The only type of bow allowed in Olympic competitions. Its limbs curve away from the archer. It is also called Classic Bow. Compound: \nThis bow has pulleys and cables to make the holding weight less than half of the draw weight. Bare-bow: This is a recurve bow without a mechanical sight or stabilizers. ARROW MAINTENANCE: NOCK REPLACEMENT 1. Remove the remaining part of the broken nock, if any. For easier removal you can slightly warm the remaining part of the nock with a flame or warm water. 2. If desired, you can use a fine sand paper on the cone of an aluminium shaft. Clean the area where the new nock will fit with 91 % isopropyl alcohol. For an Aluminium/Carbon shaft, clean the area that will receive the new nock, but do not sand it. 3. Put a drop of glue on the area where the new nock will fit, as shown below. \n 4. Press the nock onto the shaft and rotate it to spread the glue. 5. Orientate the grove of the nock so that it is square to the index vane, as in the picture below. \n 6. Give the glue time to properly set before shooting the arrow with the new nock."}

Performance Shooting distance: 22 meters Minimum required score: 115 points 13.4.5.2. Skills – Your shooting sequence should include the following: Bow hand and arm: Objective: • Consistent bow hand contact with bow grip; • Apply a minimum degree of influence to the bow grip with your bow hand; • Sufficient string clearance during the shot (this last objective will be better described in the Gold Arrow curriculum). \n  Form: Fingers are relaxed and naturally curled, but not gripping or choking the bow. The wrist is flexed and the \"V\" between forefinger and thumb is centred on the forearm axis. The bow presses on the centre of the zone made by the thumb axis and the life line. The main pressure zone is about 1 to 2.5 cm from the top of the webbing between the thumb and forefinger. The side of the palm across the life line from this “V” should not press on the centre of the grip. \n \n \n \n The bow forearm is straight but not stretched. The bow elbow is fixed and straight. The elbow point must be turned to the left for right hand archers, not toward the ground. Rationale: This bow hand grip requires very little muscle contraction and promotes relaxation. The more relaxed the archer is, the better they can perform and the less likely they are to influence the shot with their bow hand. RELEASE What happens on the string side of the archer? Objective: Continue all on-going activities, and further refine the release of the string. Form:"}

It moves along either the jaw (in the “Straight line” and “Triangle” methods) or neck (in the quadrilateral method). The string hand stops at or just beyond the string ear, often touching the ear or neck. The place where the string hand finishes is called the \"back end.\" The upper string arm ends up in the same plane as the shoulders. Rationale: Because the muscles of the back are connected to the string shoulder, their contractions affect the entire string arm and the backwards motion that it was implementing during the “full draw” sequence. \n RELEASE What happens on the bow side of the archer? Bow arm: Objective: Continue all on-going activities, the bow arm, and even the whole body moves slightly forward. Form: Upon the release of the string, the bow arm moves towards the back of the archer. \n Rationale: The deviation of the bow arm towards your back is mainly due to the continuous action of the posterior muscles of the bow shoulder in much the same way as for the string hand. The forward motions toward the target are due to the continuous push effort produced at “full draw” by the whole body from the bow arm to the string leg. Bow hand: Objectives: Continue all on-going physical activities during the arrow propulsion period (just after release). Develop a passive bow hand and fingers to get a clean arrow launch without any force being applied to the riser that could create torque in the bow at full draw and/or during the arrow propulsion period. Form: When the bow is propelled forwards after the release, your wrist gets stretched and pulled by the sling. Then when the bow cants forward and drops down, your wrist flexes down with it. \n Example of a bow hand that has been kept well relaxed until the end of the shot Rationale: The bow presses on your relaxed hand and wrist.

The World Archery Field Round consists of 12, 16, 20 or 24 targets. Three (3) arrows are shot per athlete at each target. The targets are arranged along a course with such difficulties in aiming and shooting as the terrain presents and the spirit and traditions of the discipline require. The target butts are set between 5 meters and 50 meters for Bare-bow and between 10 meters and 60 meters for Recurve and Compound. The course may be marked or unmarked. The World Archery Arrowhead Round consists of any number of targets totalling between 24 and 48 targets which is divisible by four, or in other words two complete World Archery Field Rounds. The rounds may be shot on marked or unmarked courses or one of each. ARROW MAINTENANCE Removing points (and/or inserts) When removing a metal point, insert and point together, or an insert and point in two pieces, you must: 1 - Lightly heat the exposed end of the point or insert for 3-5 seconds over a small gas flame. CAUTION: Do not overheat the component or the shaft. 2 - Grip the point with a pair of pliers. 3 -Twist and pull out the point (and/or insert if any). 4 -If the point and/or insert cannot be removed, reheat for another 3-5 seconds and try to remove again. 5 -Repeat procedure step 4 until the adhesive softens enough to remove the component. Installing points and/or inserts in the shaft Material needed for installation: • 91 % isopropyl alcohol; • Paper towels; • Cotton swabs; • Hot-melt (archery specific); • Torch or burner. The following instructions can be used for one-piece points or for aluminium inserts with a point already screwed in. After cutting your shaft to length, follow the point installation procedure carefully to prevent overheating the point. Overheating points can damage the arrow by: \n• destroying the shaft's epoxy bond between the carbon and the aluminium tube (in an aluminium/carbon shaft); • change the endurance of the aluminium in this area if aluminium shafts are being used; • destroy the epoxy that bonds the carbon fibres (in an all-carbon arrow). For gluing points and/or inserts, use hot-melt adhesive. 1. Clean approximately two inches inside the point end of the shaft using a cotton swab dipped in 91% isopropyl alcohol. Repeat the process until a fresh cotton swap is free of cutting dust, residue or other contaminants. Let the shaft dry thoroughly before bonding. 2. Carefully heat a stick of hot-melt adhesive over a small gas flame; then apply a ring of hot adhesive to the inside of the point-end of the shaft. \n CAUTION: Do not apply heat directly to the arrow shaft. The melting point of hot-melt adhesive is low enough that the shaft will not be damaged during installation and high enough to keep the point securely bonded despite the frictional heating generated when the arrow penetrates a target mat. Arrow points can come out in the target mat if a lower melting temperature hot-melt adhesive or if not enough is used. 3. Hold the end of the point with your fingers. (Do not hold with pliers because it is then possible to overheat the point.) Heat the insert portion of the point shank or insert until you feel it getting warm. It should be just hot enough to melt the adhesive. CAUTION: Do not overheat the points. If the point becomes too hot to hold in your fingers, it is too hot to put in the shaft. Set the point on a non-combustible surface until cool. 4. Heat the hot-melt adhesive and apply a generous layer of adhesive to the shank of the point or insert."}

While the adhesive is still fluid, push the point and/or insert into the shaft with rotating motion until the point flange seats against the end of the shaft. To assure an even distribution of glue, rotate the point for two complete revolutions after it has seated against the shaft. NOTE: Do not force a point and/or insert into a shaft. If it does not seat fully, reheat the point immediately for 2-3 seconds and try pushing it in again. 6. Wait for it to cool, then pick the glue ring off towards the point (away from the shaft). This has the added benefit of not wasting the excess glue; simply reheat it and put it on the end of the glue stick. CAUTION: Do not apply heat directly to an arrow shaft of any type because it could destroy the carbon fibres and/or change the endurance of the aluminium in this area. Take care to not overheat the points, because this could also cause damage in the shaft. If the head of the shaft is damaged on the point side, you may be able to use this arrow again, if its initial length before the “problem” was long enough. If there is enough shaft to safely do so, this arrow may be cut down a little to remove the damaged area. It is advisable to cut all your arrows down to the new length, for the sake of consistency.\nFLETCHING A SHAFT Feathers or vanes can be applied or replaced with a fletching jig. Without this device it is difficult to keep the vane straight on the shaft until the glue is dry. Most archery dealers re-fletch arrows, which is less expensive than buying new ones. Ideally your club should own a fletching jig. For more information, refer to section 9.4.5.3. “Fletching the arrow” from the WA Level 1 Coaching Manual \n Fletching a shaft"}

Rationale: Any string interference during the propelling step would: • make the consistent repetition of the push axis and the propelling intensity difficult; • reduce the amount of kinetic energy transmitted to the arrow. Test at the bow arm: Make a mark with a pen on one side of a length of adhesive tape. With no hand on the string, raise your bow and note where your string is located on your armguard or forearm. About 1 to 1.5 cm forwards of this spot, affix the marked piece of adhesive tape, raised about 2 mm in the middle (like a bridge), with the mark closer to the string. The bridge of tape should be affixed vertically across your bow forearm/armguard, or if you prefer, parallel to the string. The mark will help identify if the string hits the tape while it is pushing the arrow or on its way back after the arrow has left the string. Shoot one arrow with this adhesive tape in place, making sure that you do not flatten out the bridge before the draw. After the shot, look at the tape and analyse the hit (if any). If you come to the conclusion that the string clearance is too poor because the tape is damaged, ask to your coach to help you improve it. \n \n Test at the bow side chest: Either watch yourself in a mirror, or with the help of an assistant, observe where the string touches your chest at full draw (if at all). About 1 to 1.5 cm forwards of this spot affix a piece of adhesive tape that has a bridge shape – 2 mm raised in the middle. See picture below. The most critical point is the edge (hem or trim) of the chest-guard surrounding your bow shoulder. The bridge of tape should be affixed parallel to the line of the string at full draw. Shoot one arrow with this tape in place, making sure that you do not flatten out the “bridge” part before the draw. After the shot, look at the tape to analyse the hit (if any). If you come to the conclusion that the string clearance is too poor because the tape is hit, ask to your coach to help you improve it. \n FOLLOW-THROUGH Objective:"}

Archery is becoming a sport \nthat may potentially success in the 2016 Olympic Games. Therefore, research in this \nsport can be directly relevant to athlete’s performance during games tournament s. This \nresearch is considered as a preliminary study to measure the biomechanics parameters \nthat can be applied to the professional athlete. Biomechanics parameters such as muscle \nactivity, heartbeat, balance and body posture as well as the draw force line were selected \nas important parameters related to the athlete ’s performance. The subject in this study \nshot arrow s on a force plate while a high speed video camera captur ed the arrow \nvelocity, body posture and elbow angle. F urthermore, th ese parameters are then \ncorrelated with the point of the target or the archer ’s performance in order to propose \nthe correct shooting technique. The findings of this study are the draw force line angle, \nthe most active muscle, the foot weight balance and the aiming concentration release \ntime. All the results will help both coach and athlete to improve the performance of the \nsport, and especially assist both beginner level archers aiming to become expert a nd \nelite players. \n \nKeywords: Biomechanics; sport; archery; muscle; performance. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nArchery is a sport which propel arrow s with a bow to the target during shooting (Lee, \n2009). Shooting in archery can be summarized as drawing the bow, aiming and \nreleasing the arrow (McKinney & McKinney, 1997 ). In archery it is important that the \narcher is able to hold the pulling force of the bow isometrically at release. Any collapse \nor movement forward of the draw arm results in a reduction of the velocity of the arrow \nand this results in the arrow going too slowly towards the target. Therefore, over time \nimprovement and refinement of the bow and arrow are increased to get the highest \nperformance equipment (Mukaiyama, Suzuki, Miyazaki, & Sawada, 2011 ). High \nperformance shooting in archery is defined as the ability to shoot an arrow at a given \ntarget with accuracy (Soylu, Ertan, & Korkusuz, 2006 ). Alignment of the bow arm is \nimportant as it will produce a certain angle and if the alignment is incorrect the force \napplied to the muscles may increase. The forces acting on the archer may vary as the \nskill and technique levels differ from one athlete to another. It also involves the rhythms \nof releasing the arrow , which differ between elite and sub -elite archers (Hu & Tang, \n2005). The application of biomechanics in arc hery is very useful. It helps in the control"}

Moreover, the joint m ovement is also crucial \nin analyzing the motion of the human body and to better understand how or why injuries \noccur (Kristianslund, Krosshaug, & van den Bogert, 2012 ). According to the \nbiomechanics principle in archery, the forces acting on the bones should be maximize d \nwhile the force acting on the muscles should be minimized in order to reduce the injury \nimpact to the archer. The force applied should be more on the bones than on the muscles \nbecause the bones do not get tired while muscles most certainly become fatigued. \nThe angle and position of the elbow play an important role in subjecting force to \nthe shoulder. Therefore, the position of the elbow should be aligned with the line of \nforce, as the distance of the shoulder line and line of force at the shortest. This line is \ncalled the draw force line (DFL). On the other hand, an incorrect position of the elbow \ncauses muscle action to maintain the draw force line level. If this happens continuously, \nit may cause muscle fatigue, and subsequently impair the performance. In o rder to \nminimize the lateral forces of the arm, the angle between the forearm and the DFL \nshould be small. During archery shooting, the upper limb muscles are more active than \nthe lower -limb muscles due to the need to pull and hold the bow until the arrow is \nreleased. However, extremely vigorous muscle needs more strength to pull and hold the \nbow in the forearm. The forearm muscles which are commonly involved in this shooting \nare the flexor digitorum and extensor digitorum. Also involved are the deltoid muscle, \ntrapezius muscles, medial epicondylitis and pectoralis major muscle. By using \nelectromyography (EMG) equipment, the muscle activity can be detected and analy zed. \nOne of the key elements to obtain better stability in archery is to have a good stance and \nposture. The term stance specifically refers to the standing posture of the archer. Stance \nrequires strength in the legs, and the right stance can help to maintain stability while \nstanding for an extended period. Therefore, the release phase must be well-balanced and \nhighly reproducible to achieve commendable results in an archery competition (Tinazci, \n2011). The archer is required to stand st ill for qui te a period of time and having the \ncorrect stance help shim to maintain his body balance for the whole of the arrow \nshooting process. A good stance can help the archer to sustain his stability for a longer \ntime and hence helps to aim better at the target b oard. When the body is stable, the \narcher’s shots will be more consistent and less frustrating. The different levels achieved \nby archers represent different style s of stance and different weight distribution , which \ndepend on the body posture, height and bone structure. \nGeneral biofeedback is a tool to provide human beings with enhanced awareness \nof their mind -body lineage, increased control over their physiology, and increased \naccess to self -regulation strategies (Donald & Sue Vietta, 2012 ). Biofeedback can \nawaken human creativity and enable individuals to reach higher states of consciousness. \nThe biofeedback device will help to show the archer’s concentration. Therefore, the \nhigher the frequency level of an athlete, the greater the athlete’s concentration on the \ntarget. The purpose of this study is to measure the biomechanics parameter s involved in \nthe archers’ performance. These measurements are considered as a preliminary study in \norder to optimize the equipment, location and subject constraints. In conducting this \nexperiment, there are several hypotheses to test involving increasing the performance by \nensuring that the draw force is in line, red ucing the muscle activity, weight balancing \nand aiming concentration."}

The \nelbow is still not in line, which requires the drawing arm’s biceps and triceps to take all \nthe force and so creates fatigue. Ideally, the elbow should be within the DFL in order to \nreduce the muscle fatigue as well as to prevent injury. Repetition of the same technique \nwill affect the performance of the archer. The results shown in Figure 6 illustrate that \nthe DFL is almost straight , with just a slight angle out. This is in fact common with \nrecurve bow archer s. Therefore, we can assume that this is an experience d and \nknowledgeable archer. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6.DFL measured from the lateral view \n \nMuscle Activity \n \nFor this section, the measurement obtain ed from this equipment is the signal from the \nmuscle activated during the shooting process. The muscles considered for this study are \nonly in the archer’s right arm, namely the flexor digitorum and deltoid muscles. Both of \nthese muscles can cause an injury to the archer and these were the main concern (Ertan, \nKentel, Tümer, & Korkusuz, 2003 ; Soylu, et al., 2006 ; Tinazci, 2011 ). Figure 7 \nindicates the activity of the flexor digitorum muscle during shooting . There are three \nphases involved in this result; setting the bow, aiming and releasing the arrow. These \nphases are represented by the symbol s A, B and C respectively. The first phase , A, \nrepresents setting the bow and this pre-draw phase has a low amplitude compared to the \nB phase. This is because in this phase the muscle is not fully active when pulling the \nstring, and still has to put more force on it. \nThe highest amplitude in this graph, f more than 2.5mv ,occurs between 0.7 and \n1.4 seconds. This represents the B phase which is the full draw and aiming phase. It has \nthe highest amplitude because, at that time, the right arm muscle is at its most active in \nholding the string for a few second s, which requires more strength.

We measured peak torques of flexion (FL), extension (EX), abduction (ABD), adduction \n(ADD), external rotation (ER) and internal rotation (IR) of both shoulders at an angular velocity of 30°/sec, 60°/sec, and 180°/sec. The \npeak torques and peak torque ratios of FL/EX, ABD/ADD, and ER/IR of the two groups were compared.\nResults: The archer group had a greater peak torque of IR and ADD, but only in the left shoulder (p<0.05). In the same group, both \nshoulders had greater peak torque of EX and lower peak torque of FL. The peak torque ratios of FL/EX of both shoulders were signifi-\ncantly lower in the archer group at all three angular velocities (p<0.05). The peak torque ratios of ABD/ADD were significantly greater in \nonly the left shoulder of the archer group (p<0.05).\nConclusions: The prominent characteristics of the shoulder girdle muscles of an elite archer are stronger adductor muscles of the bow \nshoulder and stronger extensors of both shoulders, as compared to healthy, non-athletic individuals. These muscle groups of the shoulder \nprobably contribute a major role in maintaining the accuracy and stability during archery shooting. Hence, a training program that selec-\ntively enhances the adductor and extensor muscles could prove helpful in enhancing the archery skills of the athlete.\n(Clin Shoulder Elbow 2018;21(3):145-150)\nKey Words: Shoulder; Archery; Isokinetic muscle test\nCiSE\nClinics in Shoulder and Elbow\nCopyright © 2018 Korean Shoulder and Elbow Society.

From drawing to \nthe release phase, an archer pushes the bow towards the target \nwith one arm extended, while the other arm carries out a rhyth-\nmic and dynamic pulling of the bowstring.\n1)\n For a well-balanced \nperformance of these sequential phases, the strength and endur-\nance of both upper extremity muscles, especially the forearm \nand shoulder girdle muscles, are key factors in achieving a good \nexecution.\n2)\nA small number of studies have investigated the role of fore-\narm muscles in archery shooting,\n3-6)\n and few investigations have \nresearched the shoulder girdle muscles.\n7,8)\n Most of these studies \nfocused on the activation patterns of the forearm or shoulder \ngirdle muscles only in terms of electromyographic analysis with-\nout any kinesiologic approach, such as isokinetic measurements. \nThe past few decades has seen increasing studies in isokinetic \nmuscle strength and endurance in various sporting fields such as \nswimming, baseball, water polo and volleyball\n9-13)\n; however, to \nthe best of our knowledge, there has been no such specific study \nin archery.\nThis study was therefore undertaken to evaluate the shoulder \ngirdle muscle characteristics of elite archery athletes, and study"}

This study was approved \nby the Institutional Review Board of Korea University Anam \nHospital.\nIsokinetic Test\nAn isokinetic muscle test machine (Biodex Medical Systems, \nShirley, NY, USA) evaluated the variable shoulder movements, \nand the peak torque of each movement was measured in the \nfollowing sequence: flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, \nexternal rotation, and internal rotation of the right shoulder. \nThe subjects were seated and stabilized with a strap across the \nchest. Three positions were employed to test each motion. For \nflexion-extension, the shoulder was positioned to forward flexion \nand the elbow was extended with neutral forearm rotation. For \nabduction-adduction, the shoulder was positioned at 90° abduc-\ntion and the elbow was extended with neutral forearm rotation. \nFor external rotation-internal rotation, the position applied was \n30° of shoulder abduction with 30° of scapular plane elevation \n(30° position). The humeral axis was aligned with the rotational \naxis of the dynamometer. The elbow was supported at 90° of \nflexion, and the forearm was positioned in neutral rotation (Fig. 1).\nAll tests were performed at 60°/sec, 120°/sec and 180°/sec for \neach movement before proceeding to the next one. Movements \nof both shoulders were measured similarly. In each trial, the sub-\njects were told to complete 15 repetitions; between each trial, \nthere was a 5 minutes resting period. All participants from both \ngroups were monitored to follow the same protocol.\nStatistical analysis was conducted using the SPSS 12.0 soft-\nware (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Detailed data is presented in \nTable 3. \nDiscussion\nAn important finding of this study is that archery athletes \nhave greater internal rotation and adduction peak torque of the \nleft shoulder, as compared to non-athletic individuals. Although \nthere is no statistical significance, the extension peak torque of \nboth shoulders is also greater. The abduction/adduction ratio of \nthe left shoulder and the flexion/extension ratio of both shoul-\nders are found to be lower in archery athletes.\nIn terms of a force-velocity relationship, increasing test veloci-\nties decreases the values generated for concentric forces.\n14-16)\n \nSince archery is a rather static exercise requiring high concentric \nforce at lower speed of shoulder movement, the data derived \nfrom measurement at 180°/sec angular velocity should not be \nconsidered for a more appropriate evaluation. Therefore, we \ninterpret that the adduction peak torque on the left shoulder of \narchery athletes is greater than that of non-athletes, even though \nthe value at 180°/sec angular velocity is statistically not different. \nWe observed lower flexion peak torques and higher extension \npeak torques in the archery athletes than the non-athletic group; \nthe difference is not considered negligible due to the borderline \np-value, and we believe the difference would be statistically sig-\nnificant with an increased sample size.\nThese findings are closely associated with archery shooting \nand posture. Archery shooting consists of six segments, which \ninclude bow hold, drawing, full draw, aiming, release, and \nfollow-through. During full draw and aiming phase, the archer \nmaintains the posture for a few seconds; the shoulder muscles \nare mostly activate during this phase. For a stable posture, the \ndrawing shoulder requires enough pulling strength to resist \nbending power of the bow. This could be the reason why exten-\nsion peak torque of the drawing shoulder (right shoulder in this \nstudy) is greater in the archer group. Muscle activation of the \nbow shoulder is more complicated. The angle of the bow arm \nis slightly elevated and forward flexed against the line connect-\ning both shoulders during full draw and aiming phase (Fig. 2). \nBecause the bow arm is obliquely oriented towards the line of \nforce made by the bow and string in both coronal and trans -\nverse planes, more extension and adduction shoulder power is \nrequired to stabilize the bow arm. \nDuring athletics, the agonist muscles produce concentric \nwork to accelerate the limb forward, whereas the antagonist \nmuscles control or decelerate this concentric work, thereby pre-\nventing joint overloading.14,17-19)\n In this study, we found that the \npeak torque ratios of flexion/extension of both shoulder girdle \nmuscles at all angular velocities are significantly lower in the ar-\nchery athletic group compared with the non-athletic group. This \nindicates that the shoulder extension strength of an elite archer \nis relatively stronger than the flexion strength. This can therefore \nbe interpreted that the shoulder extensor muscles play an im-\nportant role as primary antagonist to resist the force generated \nby bow and string. The flexor muscles act as a second antagonist \nTable 3.

Significant differences are observed only in comparison \nof peak torque ratios of flexion/extension in our study. However, \nwith a larger sample size, additional characteristic feature could \npossibly be identified which would help distinguish elite archers \nfrom non-athletic individuals. Second, although this study is \nage and sex-matched, obvious differences exist between the \ntwo groups with respect to body weight and body muscle. This \nwould affect the diversity of peak torque values obtained from \neach individual, and therefore interrupt an adequate analysis \nof isokinetic strength profile of the shoulder. Third, although an \nimportant component for archery athletes, muscle endurance \nwas not investigated in this study. Finally, we did not assess the \nperiscapular muscle activities because special attachments which \nare required to assess the periscapular muscle activity, were not \navailable. \nAlthough there are some limitations in this study, to the best \nof our knowledge this is the first study to analyze the isokinetic \nstrength profile of the shoulders in an elite archery team. \nA B\nFig. 2.

N.T.S. is USA Archery’s “National Training System”. I believe NTS is a reliable method of teaching students how to shoot archery with great success. NTS combines biomechanical efficiency with a sequential shooting process. NTS uses a Biomechanical Efficient Shooting Technique aka “BEST”. BEST outlines how to use your body to shoot a bow consistently and efficiently while also reducing the chances of injury. A sequential shooting processes used for NTS is the KSL shot cycle. Kisik Lee (KSL) is the U.S. National and Olympic Head Coach. As I understand, the KSL shot cycle is a 12 step shooting process. \n I teach NTS in four Levels. In each level the student learns new steps of the shot cycle and how to execute them using BEST. It is important that the student becomes proficient in one level before moving on to the next level, as more advanced skills will rely on using and/or modifying previous skills. Level 1 introduces 5 steps, stance, nock, hook, grip, and anchor. Additionally Level 1 introduces fundamental posture and how to position your bow arm so the string does not hit it. Level 2 introduces 4 additional steps, release, follow through, set, and set up. Additionally Level 2 modifies the original stance and introduces an open stance. Level 3 introduces 3 more steps, draw, transfer, and expand. Additionally Level 3 introduces two body positions that are critical to NTS: “barrel of the gun” shoulder/arm alignment, and “loosey goosey” scapula position for targeting back tension. And finally, level 3 introduces the correct front shoulder position with the “v” notch bow shoulder. Level 4 introduces the completed KSL shot cycle, and the specific techniques unique to Olympic recurve or Barebow archery styles. I would like to add, one of the most difficult parts of learning good form is having enough self-control to resist the temptation of releasing the arrow before you should. Do not be in a hurry to release the arrow. Surprisingly, my goal when working on form is not actually to shoot an arrow! Instead the goal is to learn how to efficiently set the body in preparation to shoot an arrow. The archer must be mentally focused and in control of their actions. Ideally, only after all the preparatory body positions are achieved and set should the archer release the arrow. Releasing an arrow without first focusing on preceding body positioning will not help the archer to get better."}

Feet shoulder width apart with toes parallel with the shooting line \n • Nock – Be sure the arrow snaps on to the string correctly in relation to the nock locator(s) with the index fletch in the correct orientation according to the arrow rest. \n • Hook – using the index, middle, and ring finger of the drawing hand to hook on to the string. Keep thumb and pinky finger tucked in to the palm. In Level 1 we start with a 3 under hook. Hook all three fingers on the string below the arrow. For now, place the string in the crease of the knuckles closest to the fingertips of all three fingers.\n\n• Grip – There are four key points to the grip. One, make sure the thumb is on the side of the bow pointing forward towards the target. Two, rotate the hand so the knuckles are at approx 45 degrees to the ground. Three, bend the wrist back to press the heel/pad, of the thumb directly behind the handle. Four, relax and fold the fingers gently over. Two fingers on the bow, two fingers off the bow. Do not cross any finger over the center line of the front of the bow. \n • Anchor – In level 1 we start with a corner of the mouth anchor. Draw the bow so that you can cup your cheek with the three fingers of your hook and simultaneously touch the back corner of your mouth with the tip of your index finger. Your thumb should be tucked under your jaw bone."}

Instead, let the string move your relaxed fingers out of its way as it shoots. To learn this, the “release drill” can be used. \n • Follow Through – Once the string is released, the elbow of the release hand should move angularly (in an arc) down and back, which in turn should pull the fingers across the archer’s cheek stopping at the archer’s neck. To learn this, the “follow through” drill can be used. \n • Open Stance – At this time it is recommended to change the stance to an open stance.

Ruhi Soylu2 \nAnadolu University, Faculty of Sports Science, Eskişehir, Turkey1 \nSchool of Medicine, Biophysics Department, Hacettepe University, Ankara, \nTurkey2 \nThe study investigated shooting techniques of the archers with kinetic and kinematic \nmethods. Twenty-seven archers of different skill levels have been involved into the \ncurrent study to investigate both muscular activation strategies of nine muscles and some \nkinematic data on drawing hand side. A statistical significant difference (p<0.05) has \nbeen observed in terms of muscular activation among the archer groups . Although there \nwas no statistical significance (p>0.05) in the time-dependent exchange values of the \nangle of the joints, a difference was detected in the graphical sense. Elite archers use \ndistal muscles less but proximal and axial muscles more, and mid-level and novice \narchers use distal muscles more to pull the bowstring. This was interpreted to be the \nmost important factor affecting the horizontal oscillation (lateral diflection) of bowstring. \nKEY WORDS: electromyography (EMG), muscle activation, relaxation strategy \nINTRODUCTION: Archery can be described as an elegant, impulsive and closed motor skill, \nis a static sport requiring strength and endurance of the upper body, in particular the forearm \nand shoulder girdle (Mann & Littke, 1989). The contraction and relaxation strategy in forearm \nmuscles during the release of the bowstring is critical for accurate and reproducible scoring \nin archery. Two different approaches to this strategy were proposed in previous studies; \nhowever, they were not well defined (Clarys et al., 1990; Nishizono et al., 1987, Ertan et al., \n2005). The first approach suggested that an archer should release the bowstring through a \nsudden relaxation of the muscles that maintain the ﬂexed position of the ﬁngers around the \nbowstring rather than attempting to effect the release moment by willingly extending the \nﬁngers through concentric antagonistic muscle action (Martin et al., 1990 ; Ertan., 2005). The \nsecond approach suggested the relaxation of the ﬂexors and contraction of the extensors. \nMuscular coordination between the agonist and antagonist muscles of the forearm is \nessential in this strategy and requires a relatively long training period (Clarys et al., 1990; \nHennessy & Parker, 1990; Nishizono et al., 1987). Previous studies were not able to clarify \nthe contraction and relaxation strategy of the forearm muscles that was used by archers. All \nstudies were conﬁned to a limited number of elite archers and both strategies were \nsometimes observed in the same group. Moreover studies did only involve the forearm \nmuscles that are crucial for accurate and reproducible scoring, but the activity of upper \nextremity muscles was not measured. Furthermore, the effect of performance level on this \nstrategy was not investigated. We hypothesized that archers develop a speciﬁc forearm and \npull ﬁnger muscle activation strategy by active contraction of the forearm extensors with the \nfall of the clicker. Furthermore, the reaction time is expected to be shorter as the level of \nperformance of the archer increases. \n \nMETHODS: Three groups, (i) elite (n=9), mid-level (n=9) and novice (n=9) archers, were \ninvolved in the study. All subjects gave their informed consent after being informed of the \npossible risks of the study. The experimental procedures conformed to the Declaration of \nHelsinki and were approved by the local ethics committee. Before starting the test session, \nthe participants performed a 15 min standardised warm-up, consisting of 5-min upper body \nactive movement, 5 min upper body stretching and 5 min arrow shooting. Each participant \nengaged in a single test session consisting of 6 shots. Prior to the shootings, the isometric \nmaximum voluntary contraction (MVIC) was optained of M.

The pass band of the \nEMG amplifier, sampling rate, maximum intra- electrode impedance and CMMR were 20 –\n500 Hz, 2000 Hz, 6 kOhms and 95 dB, respectively).The snap of the clicker triggered a 5V \nTransistor- Transistor Logic (TTL) signal, which was registered simultaneously with the \nmyoelectric signals. According to the rise of the TTL signal, muscular activation 400ms \nbefore and 800ms after were identified as pre-clicker and post-clicker intervals. The \nrespective EMG data sets of each of the twelve shots were fully-wave rectified and filtered (a \nmoving midlevel filter with a 100ms time-window). \nKinematic data collection and analysis : Two motion BLITZ Cube7 brand, 500Hz high-speed \nvideo cameras were used to record the scene during full draw, aiming and releasing phases \nin our experimental design. The cameras were settled at an angle of 70 0 towards each other \nat a height of 1.5 meters. The successful trials of 6 shots were digitized from camera records. \n17 markers (Distal Falanks (DF), Distal Interfalangeal Joint (DIJ), Proximal Interfalangeal \nJoint (PIJ), Metakarpo-Falangeal Joint (MJ), Ulnar-Styloid (US) Lateral-Epicondyle (LE) \nTermination alignment triceps brachii, Trochanter Major (TM)) were automatically digitized \nusing WINanalyze Automatic Motion Analyse system. \nStatistical analysis: Descriptive statistics were applied to identify the characteristics of the \nsubjects and groups. Mean scores were calculated for each subject ’s 6 shots and each \ngroup separetelly. One-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) was conducted to \ncompare forearm muscular activity during each time interval among groups. ANOVA was \nfollowed by Tukey posthoc comparisons to determine the intervals where significant \ndifferences did occur. A probability of p < 0.05 was selected to indicate statistical \nsignificance. \n \nRESULTS: For each group of archers, muscular activations 400ms before and 800 ms after \nthe snap of the clicker and kinematic values have been measured. \nMuscular Activation Strategies : Muscular activation values of MEDC , MFDS, MDA, MDM, \nMDP, MUT , MMT, and MPM were compared among the archery groups in terms of their \namplitudes. The activation level of MEDC, MFDS, MDM, MDP, MUT, MMT and MLT among \ngroups have shown significant differences (p<0.05), however no significant differences \n(p>0.05) have been calculated in MDA, MUT and MPM. \nKinematic Data: In addition to kinetic data collected by EMG, some kinematic measurements \nwere also conducted to analyse the effect of muscular involvement on angular changes of 2., \n3., 4., finger distal and proximal interfalangeal, Ulnar-Styloid and Lateral-Epicondyle joints. \nAlthough there has been no statistical significance (p>0.05) in the time-dependent exchange \nvalues of the angle of the joints, a difference has been detected in the graphical sense \n(Figure 1). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n269"}

Novice archers were \nobserved to activate forearm flexor and extensor muscles higher than their own maximal \nvalues in 400msec time before dropping the clicker at aiming phase. As they release the \nsting the flexor muscle activity starts decreasing gradually whereas the extensor muscle \nactivity starts increasing. Compared to novice archers, midlevel archers showed lower MVC \npercentages of flexor and extensor muscle activities. However, both flexor and extensor \nactivities tended to increase as soon as the clicker was dropped. As for the elite archers, in \naddition to their lower maximal value percentages than both novice and midlevel archers, \ntheir muscular activation values gradually decreased as well.

Muscular activation strategies at \n400msec before dropping clicker during aiming and shooting phase were observed to show \nsimilar results with the previous studies in literature. On the other hand, there are limited \nresearch related to muscular activation of shoulder and back muscles. Nishizono et al. \n(1987) conducted a study on bow arm and pulling arm of novice archers during whole pulling \nand releasing steps and found out that trapezius and deltoid muscles had unbalanced \nactivities and biceps muscle had strong activities during the pulling step. , It was observed \nthat when the main pulling step was approaches posterior deltoid muscle and trapezius \nmiddle muscle of elite archers were actively involved with higher level of MVIC in the \nprocess. On the contrary, Lower trapezius muscles of midlevel and novice archers were \nmore active. This situation can be explained with resultant force concept of basic physic \ntheories. Elite archers approximate scapula bone to spine forming a 45 degree angle with \nthe help of the horizontal force applied by middle trapezius and rhomboideus major-minor \nmuscles as a result of resultant of vertical force applied by trapezius. As for midlevel and \nnovice archers, they usually call out lower trapezius muscle and move scapula bone \ndownward vertically. This contraction strategy applied by novice and mid-level archers cause \nthe demolishment of the kinetic chain among scapular, gleno-humeral, elbow, wrist and hand \njoints. \n \nCONCLUSION: \nAs a conclusion, the current findings may demonstrate that as the performance level \nincreases in archery, the weight of the bow string is carried by proximal muscles. On other \nsaying, beginner and mid-level archers tend to use distal musculature to pull the bow string. \n \nREFERENCES \nAkito, M., Kazutoshi, K., Tatsuyuki, K., Kimitaka, N. (2013).
